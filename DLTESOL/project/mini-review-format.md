# ðŸ’™ We Made a Story (review)

Overall, the group provided an interesting presentation and a video. It was a good opportunity for everyone to be introduced to a nice digital tool for teachers and students:-)

In this project, the group introduced a digital app for creating stories. It's an app that can make learning English composition more interesting with prompt feedback by AI, and it seems like it could be very helpful. However, basic information about the app (such as the official app name and direct web page links) was not clearly organized on the main page (Try to review the page again as a separate document). Additionally, considering the students' levels, it is necessary to consider whether they can use the app on their own in English, or what kind of instructions and how much introduction time might be needed to use this app in class. The app introduction could have been better if detailed content on the specific advantages and challenges of its use were discussed. It is unfortunate that only a general summary of the content is presented.
