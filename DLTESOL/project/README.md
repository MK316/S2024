# üåø Final project
_This project plan might change depending on any suggestions or adjustments we need to make along the way. But don't worry, any changes will be kept to a minimum, if there are any at all._

+ The final project involves each group designing a class using provided materials and planning creative activities. Throughout the process, various digital tools must be used, with **each group required to use at least two coding apps.** The texts are middle school-level story materials, which will be assigned to each group.
+ The language objectives include four language skills: reading, writing, speaking, and listening. You can choose from these to structure your learning activities. However, it is necessary to provide specific examples in each part to clearly demonstrate what language learning is being undertaken and what language skills are being learned. For example, consider various activities such as teaching vocabulary, learning expressions, explaining grammar, reading aloud, essay writing, movie/book reviews, and/or quizzes.
+ To make this presentation more engaging, let's **assign roles**: One of the members should be **the main presenter**, taking the audience through the content; we'll have **a teacher role**, who can provide insights and answer questions, demonstrating instructions for specific activities; and we'll also have **two students roles**, who can actively participate in the given activities, raise potential questions, and share their perspectives. This way, we can ensure that everyone is involved and that we get diverse viewpoints on the topic. (Decide on role assignments within your groups.)
  
## üçÉ Final presentation (6/11, 6/18) 
+ [Schedule: Go to](https://wheelofnames.com/)
+ Class demo: This is a demonstration where you explain how a class is conducted (with concrete examples) to the audience rather than directly teaching the class. In our presentation, the audience consists of fellow teachers, so you just need to summarize as specifically as possible what kind of class is possible with your language applications.

|Date|Groups|Text material|
|--|--|--|
|6/11||Story01; Story02|
|6/18||Story03; Story04|

+ Duration: (max.) 40 minutes (20 minutes presentation + 10 minutes Q&A + 10 minutes evaluation)
+ Format: Each group presents their developed app and its relevance to learning English through text. 
+ Content: Include learning objectives, detailed app features, demonstration, shared link for the audience, expected timeframes for activities, types of activities, instructions for use, etc.
+ Q&A Session: Allow for questions from the audience to clarify any aspects of the presented apps.

## üìô Submission format (md files)

## üçÉ Evaluation Criteria Guideline (35 pts in total)

|Category|Question|Pts available|
|--|--|--|
|**Alignment**| How well does the app align with the specified learning objectives?|5|
|**Integration**| How well does the app incorporate various language learning aspects, rather than just providing simple activities?|3|
|**Engagement**| To what extent does the app facilitate student-centered activities?|3|
|**Stimulation**| How effectively does the app stimulate interest and motivation for learning?|3|
|**Support**| Is there sufficient and appropriate guidance provided within the app for student use?|3|
|**Accessibility**| How easily can students access the app?|3|
|**Interaction**| Do the learning activities actively engage students?|3|
|**Autonomy**| How does the app support students in conducting activities independently?|3|
|**Adaptability**| Does the app accommodate learning at various proficiency levels?|3|
|**Presentation**| How clear and understandable are the visual and textual presentations in the app?|3|
|**Contribution**| How effectively did each group member contribute to the overall task? (PM, Coder, MD)|3|

*Note: There will be a self-evaluation expressing individuals' contribution on the overall activities over the course. All combined, your final grade for the project will be determined.

## üìó Story text
Each group will select one of the following four stories to proceed with their final project.

**<Synopsis>**
In the village of Lila, the "Tree of Dreams" was said to make dreams come true, a legend mostly regarded as a children's tale. Maria, a poor but talented young artist, inspired by this legend, whispered her wish to the tree for help in a national art competition. Miraculously, she received a donation of art supplies the next day. Using these, she created a winning painting of the Tree of Dreams, earning a scholarship and transforming her and her village's belief in the power of dreams, thus reaffirming the tree's magical reputation as a beacon of hope and inspiration.

In Echo Ridge, a mountain village enriched with legends of the "Guardian of the Glen" eagle, adventurous Alex discovers an ancient map in a library book that hints at a hidden treasure in Whispering Hollow cave. Along with friends Mia and Sam, Alex embarks on a challenging expedition through dense forests and rugged terrain. Upon reaching the cave, they find not gold, but historical artifacts including a statuette of the Guardian eagle, which they donate to the local museum. This discovery not only cements their status as local heroes but revitalizes the village's interest in its own lore and history, continuing the legend of the Guardian as a symbol of adventure and cultural heritage.

The remarkable growth of these plants brought the community together, with neighbors sharing seeds and gardening tips. Inspired by the peddler, Tom later became a peddler himself, spreading joy and community spirit by selling magic seeds to other villages. Tom's story became a symbol of how small acts of kindness and curiosity can lead to widespread beauty and unity.

**<Synopsis>**
In a small coastal town, the aging lighthouse keeper, Mr. Elias, and his grandson, Jamie, faced a crisis when the town council decided to replace the old lighthouse lamp with a modern electronic navigation system. During a fierce storm, the new system failed, jeopardizing the safety of ships at sea. In desperation, Elias handed Jamie an old lantern to signal the ships, a dim but steadfast light. Jamie's brave effort with the lantern successfully guided a ship to safety, proving the old lighthouse's worth. The council restored and enhanced the lighthouse, learning the value of blending tradition with innovation. Inspired, Jamie eventually became the lighthouse keeper, merging old and new navigational methods to ensure the lighthouse remained a reliable beacon. This story underscored the enduring importance of wisdom and tradition in modern times.
