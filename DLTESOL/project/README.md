# üåø Final project
_This project plan is subject to change based on suggestions or necessary adjustments over time._

+ The final project involves each group designing a class using provided materials and planning creative activities. Throughout the process, various digital tools must be used, with **each group required to use at least two coding apps.** The texts are middle school-level story materials, which will be assigned to each group.
+ The language objectives include four language skills: reading, writing, speaking, and listening. You can choose from these to structure your learning activities.
+ For example, consider various activities such as teaching vocabulary, learning expressions, explaining grammar, reading aloud, writing reviews, and quizzes.

## üçÉ Final presentation (6/11, 6/18) 
+ [Schedule: Go to](https://wheelofnames.com/)
+ Class demo: This is a demonstration where you explain how a class is conducted (with concrete examples) to the audience rather than directly teaching the class. In our presentation, the audience consists of fellow teachers, so you just need to summarize as specifically as possible what kind of class is possible with your language applications.

|Date|Groups|Text material|
|--|--|--|
|6/11||Story01; Story02|
|6/18||Story03; Story04|

+ Duration: (max.) 40 minutes (20 minutes presentation + 10 minutes Q&A + 10 minutes evaluation)
+ Format: Each group presents their developed app and its relevance to learning English through text. 
+ Content: Include learning objectives, detailed app features, demonstration, shared link for the audience, expected timeframes for activities, types of activities, instructions for use, etc.
+ Q&A Session: Allow for questions from the audience to clarify any aspects of the presented apps.

**<Synopsis>**
In the village of Lila, the "Tree of Dreams" was said to make dreams come true, a legend mostly regarded as a children's tale. Maria, a poor but talented young artist, inspired by this legend, whispered her wish to the tree for help in a national art competition. Miraculously, she received a donation of art supplies the next day. Using these, she created a winning painting of the Tree of Dreams, earning a scholarship and transforming her and her village's belief in the power of dreams, thus reaffirming the tree's magical reputation as a beacon of hope and inspiration.

**<Synopsis>**
In a small coastal town, the aging lighthouse keeper, Mr. Elias, and his grandson, Jamie, faced a crisis when the town council decided to replace the old lighthouse lamp with a modern electronic navigation system. During a fierce storm, the new system failed, jeopardizing the safety of ships at sea. In desperation, Elias handed Jamie an old lantern to signal the ships, a dim but steadfast light. Jamie's brave effort with the lantern successfully guided a ship to safety, proving the old lighthouse's worth. The council restored and enhanced the lighthouse, learning the value of blending tradition with innovation. Inspired, Jamie eventually became the lighthouse keeper, merging old and new navigational methods to ensure the lighthouse remained a reliable beacon. This story underscored the enduring importance of wisdom and tradition in modern times.
