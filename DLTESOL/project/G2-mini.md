# ðŸ’™ We Made a Story (review)

Overall, the group provided an interesting presentation and a video. It was a good opportunity for everyone to be introduced to a nice digital tool for teachers and students:-)

In this project, the group introduced a digital app for creating stories. It's an app that can make learning English composition more interesting with prompt feedback by AI, and it seems like it could be very helpful. However, basic information about the app (such as the official app name and direct web page links) was not clearly organized on the main page (Try to review the page again as a separate document). Additionally, considering the students' levels, it is necessary to consider whether they can use the app on their own in English, or what kind of instructions and how much introduction time might be needed to use this app in class. The app introduction could have been better if detailed content on the specific advantages and challenges of its use were discussed. It is unfortunate that only a general summary of the content is presented.

|R1|	Great Work!|
|R2	|It would be even better if they used more language-related approaches such as how to teach vocabulary from the text the tool created.|
|R3	|The tool was very interesting and young learners would be very motivated because they can actually have an outcome. The presentation was also great! To make the activity more practical, you can give students more specific guidelines or instructions to follow!|
|R4|Presentation organized well and introduced a good tool.|
|R5	|Its function as AI story + image creator can be useful for teaching kids. Thanks for letting us know about this tool.|
|R6	|In 'We Made a Story' tool, scaffolding techniques enhance students' creativity and engagement in writing tasks.|
|R7	|It was interesting to see their approach that they used the topic, Fu Bao, the most well-loved and popular panda in Korea these days. However, from the perspective of learning/teaching English, using an AI story-maker tool for Ss to make their own stories doesnâ€™t seem to be helpful for Ss to improve their skills to be creative by thinking in English and to interact with the other Ss and the tool itself. Especially, if Ts allow Ss to use any creation tool for their task creating something such as making a story or writing an essay, it might be able to make Ss be getting more dependent on using AI tools on their tasks. Those AI creation tools could be used when Ss compare and contrast their creation with that of AI toolsâ€™ in order to get some help in learning English.|
|R8	|I think 'Hangout forum' is very attractive. This helps students feel more comfortable and allows teachers to keep an eye on the discussions. Hangouts are good for getting students to talk and work together without feeling stressed, especially at the beginning of a class.|
|R9	|Thanks for introducing new tool! I want to use it in my writing class.|
|R10|	Thanks.!|
|R11|	There should be additional activity related to the story, such as vocabulary activity or reading.|
|R12|	Your visuals were effective in conveying key points.|
|R13|	Great video!|
|R14|	Through this, students can get an opportunity to get used to online tools ,and it looks fun making their own stories!|
