# ðŸ’™ We Made a Story (review)
This project introduces a digital tool for creating visual materials called Genially. It presents a good language learning tool that allows for dynamic integration of various multimedia into visual information, which I think has been very educational for English teachers. The app's practicality and potential are well presented, however, it seems that more consideration is needed for the actual students. For instance, if we consider the topics of video examples, it could be insightful to think about how English learning will be structured around the content that students will encounter when using the app, or even recognize that teaching how to use the app is part of the language learning process. This might allow us to consider the language skills students will gain from a student-centric perspective of language learning. When considering a preparatory lesson, it would have been more helpful for the teachers being introduced to this tool to think more concretely about its applicability if more specific examples were shown rather than, for example, just describing 'the teacher explains it concretely.'

As interesting as the app was, there were many questions and there were desires for these questions to be included in the introduction.
