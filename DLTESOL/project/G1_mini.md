# Voki in Class (review)

Voki seems to be a highly useful learning tool because it allows for the use of visual avatars and generates voice, plus you can create presentations directly within the app. However, since it offers a lot of features, it seems like the real benefits would come with a paid subscription. So, let's keep questioning what parts of this app can be utilized through coding, and also explore alternative methods or approaches that may not offer the exact same features but could still yield similar effects.

It would have been great to showcase some examples of learning materials created using Voki, so the audience could see them even outside of the presentation time. Also, considering the app is in English, it's worth discussing whether it's accessible to students at their proficiency level and analyzing specifically what language skills students might develop through this activity.

|R1|	Using Avartar throuth Voki is interesting and the management of class will be helpful for teachers.|
|R2	|It was great overall, but it would be better if they made a concrete lesson plan using Voki so that .|
|R3	|"After listening to the presentation for the first time, I empathized with the points raised by the professor. From the perspective of an English instructor currently teaching elementary students, I believe that the website may be somewhat challenging for elementary students, and it may take considerable time for them to learn and become familiar with it. Furthermore, I felt that the design and functionality of the website seemed somewhat disconnected from current AI technology. Given that elementary students nowadays encounter advanced technology at a younger age than my generation did, I didn't think the program would be particularly user-friendly for them. Lastly, I was concerned that the imperfect pronunciation of the AI could lead young students to acquire incorrect pronunciation and accents at a young age. While the AI in the presentation was intriguing and the content was well-organized and delivered, I had doubts about whether the chosen AI would be beneficial for today's students among the multitude of available AIs. Additionally, I felt that there were some shortcomings in terms of integrating TESOL into educational direction and utilizing lesson plans."
|R4|	Thanks for your presentation. I learned from your presentation that Voki can be a promising tool for students who are self-conscious or lack confidence. The procedures you provided were thoroughly explained with the help of screen captures, which greatly aided in my understanding how to use it. Personally, I found myself quite curious about how the class would be conducted using this tool. Seeing the complete design or having more detailed instructions would really pique my interest. Nevertheless, it was particularly insightful that they provided examples of the tool's various applications!|
|R5	|Excellent use of the digital tool! The activity will be motivating to young learners.|
|R6	|It was a good presentation for me because I could get some information of Voki.|
|R7	|Great job, my group mates! >.<|
|R8	|I think 'Hangout forum' is very attractive. This helps students feel more comfortable and allows teachers to keep an eye on the discussions. Hangouts are good for getting students to talk and work together without feeling stressed, especially at the beginning of a class.|
|R9	|Voki that Group 1 introduced seems to give Ss chances to interact with each other and with the website, which might be quite useful to be applied in class although it appears to be restricted to use in certain levels or ages. Nonetheless, their video and the md file were helpful enough to understand what they‚Äôre trying to say.|
|R10|	Good job!|
|R11|	It was good, however for the young learners, giving concrete time might make the students nervous (e.g. discourse marker)|
|R12|	It was good to know. Thank you for your nice presentation.|
|R13|	Thank you for presenting in my absence!|
|R14|	I understand what this is, and it is useful to release stress when beginners practice English, but it would be more efficient if they showed the various ways to adjust it to classes.|
