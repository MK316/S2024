6/11/24 20:46,Group 1,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"I think the most valuable lesson is that if I can think of it, it's probably possible with coding! I would love to learn how to connect LMS to the apps!","I think that during the presentation, the teacher could have made the students read the questions aloud but as it was a mock lesson, I think she was just nervous, as she did have Ss talk a lot when we practiced each time."
6/11/24 20:47,Group 1,6,5,3,5,4,3,4,3,5,4,The firtst activty can make student understand vocabulary meaning and pronunciation at the same time.,It can be better if it is easy to approach the apps.
6/11/24 20:47,Group 1,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,학생들을 위한 Scaffolding이 잘 설계되어 있었다. Students 페이지를 통해서 학생들이 해야할 것들이 한 눈에 보이고 각 앱을 어떻게 사용하는지 instruction이 잘 적혀 있었고 선생님도 데모를 통해 잘 보여주었다.,수업 후 학생들에게 온라인으로 어떻게 피드백을 줄 것인지 구체적으로 생각해보면 좋겠다.
6/11/24 20:47,Group 1,6,5,4,6,6,6,5,5,4,6,Give a template as scaffolding to write a promt to make their own image through AI,Consider to deal with various proficiency levels
6/11/24 20:48,Group 1,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,5,6,Using various applications and technological tools makes learning more engaging and fun.,It would be even better if the team had used fewer apps to help students concentrate on language acquisition itself. Find a balance between fun and learning.
6/11/24 20:48,Group 1,5,4,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,Flashcard app was very impressive. I think it’s very helpful for students and easy to use.,Maybe Ss would need more detailed instruction in real class but you guys did a great job!
6/11/24 20:48,Group 1,5,5,4,4,6,6,5,4,6,5,"With appropriate level (easy to difficult), students can easily follow the class.",They were doing great!
6/11/24 20:49,Group 1,5,5,4,4,5,4,4,5,5,6,포스트 액티비티,앱을 학생들이 어떻게 활용하고 참여하는 지를 보여줄 수 있으면 더 좋았을것 같아요.
6/11/24 20:49,Group 1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,Post listening part was the most valuable to me because learners can share their ideas.,Giving teacher's feedback
6/11/24 20:50,Group 1,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,확실한 교육 목표를 세우고 이에 맞게 차근차근 수업을 진행하는 것이 좋았습니다.,수업 전반적인 진행이 기존의 수업 틀에서 벗어나 있지 않았습니다. 앱을 활용하여 학생들이 단어와 문제를 재미있게 풀수는 있지만 그외에 부분에서 별다른 특별함을 받지 멋하였습니다. 학습 콘텐츠는 매우 좋지만 온라인 수업의 강점이 빠진 것 같습니다.
6/11/24 20:51,Group 1,5,5,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,"In the last, student generate the new images and the output was outstanding. Using the AI app for the class was offering real-time feedback and additional resources. And the scaffolding of the process was very good.",설명과 활용이 같은 페이지에 있으면서 교사가 화면 바깥으로 이동을 해서인지 몰입력이 조금 떨어진 부분은 아쉬웠습니다.
6/11/24 20:51,Group 1,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,Group work! I feel thankful to my group members for the helping and guiding towards the final project.,"앱으로 구현하는데에 어려움을 겪었기 때문에, 코드를 만드는 것 뿐만 아니라 그 코드를 ai를 통해서 만들려고 시도 할 때에 알맞은 명령을 주는게 어려운 것 같습니다. 이번 기회를 통해서 코딩을 접해본 것이 의미가 있었고 발전하는 ai tool 들을 사용하여 어떻게 티칭에 접목시켜야 할지 생각해 볼 수 있는 시간이어서 좋았습니다!! 감사합니다!"
6/11/24 20:53,Group 1,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,5,6,6,"Great lesson plan structure. 음원을 여러 번 듣는 기회가 있어 좋았고, 점차 난이도를 높인 부분도 좋았음. 이미지 생성을 scaffolding 과 함께 초보자도 누구나 쉽게 할 수 있게 해주어 학생들이 흥미를 갖고 참여할 수 있을 것 같음.",굳이 제안하자면 T/F 질문에 feedback이 제시되었으면 더 좋았을 것 같음. 결과를 보고 추후에 discussion 하는 기회가 있으면 더 좋겠지만 간단한 문제는 간단한 설명으로도 학생들이 이해할 수 있을 것 같음.
6/11/24 20:54,Group 1,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,3,4,I liked the scaffolding process of making students immerse themselves in the content by listening to the text several times.,
6/11/24 20:54,Group 1,5,5,6,6,5,5,6,4,5,4,I think Engagement was the most impressive part as the teacher kept making sure with questions if the students understood and the students followed well after the instructions.,Everything looked great and each member did well in spite of possible tension or nervousness as the first order of the presentation.

6/18/24 20:50,Group 2,5,5,5,5,5,6,5,5,4,6,I loved the use of QR codes. The google sheet/excel use to make a classroom dictionary is such a good idea to make the classroom vocabulary manageable for students. I really love the letter maker. It gives the students a way to relate to the character in the story. The scaffolding for this activity was also really good by providing options for the introduction and conclusion. The grandpa reply was really cool! I like that the teacher checked in with the students. I like that the last writing activity lets the students be more creative!,"The dictionary definitions may be a bit difficult for the students to understand so they should be simplified. Is this meant to be a listening lesson or a reading lesson? If it's listening, it might be a good idea to listen to the story once before and then to have only images for the story order activity. Also, you might want to do some modeling for the students like how to upload to Padlet (unless they've done it before). I also think some of the vocabulary in the letter maker activity is a little bit above the student's level so it might be very difficult for lower-level students. In regards to the email quiz, was this information taught in the lesson explicitly or in a previous lesson? When checking in with students, the teacher should be careful not to say ""do you understand?"" as students will say yes even if they don't. Rather, they can ask them to answer a question."
6/18/24 20:50,Group 2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,Good job,Great

6/18/24 20:51,Group 2,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,5,4,Online dictionary apps targeting the target students can be useful.,Clear instruction of activities.
6/18/24 20:51,Group 2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,Overall presentation and lesson plan are well-organized.,Adaptability - how to cover level differences among students
6/18/24 20:53,Group 2,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,전반적으로 앱구성이 좋았습니다. 특히 학생들이 앱에 접근하는 방식과 사용하게 하는 방식이 쉽고 이해하기 좋았습니다.,딱히 없었습니다. 준비가 잘 되어있었다고 느꼈습니다.
6/18/24 20:53,Group 2,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,6,4,6,장르를 기반으로 한 쓰기 연습이 유용했다고 생각합니다. 쓰기는 가르치기 어려운만큼 다양한방법으로 지도할수록 좋다고 생각합니다.,"학습자들의 상호작용적인 요소, 실제 편지에 답장을 쓰는 부분이 인상깊었습니다."
6/18/24 20:53,Group 2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"정보를 어떤 식으로 어떻게 사용할 수 있다는 점, 즉 target learner와 situation에 따라 코딩을 무궁무진하게 활용할 수 있다는 점이 인상깊었습니다. 또한 학생들을 중심으로 그들이 직접 task를 완수함으로써 수업의 흥미도, motivation 에 코딩이 직접적으로 기여할 수 있음을 시사하였습니다.",허깅페이스도 좋은데 기회가 된다면 young learner를 위해서 배경이 알록달록하고 글씨체가 customazed 되는 그런 프로그램을 연구해 보고 싶습니다.
6/18/24 20:54,Group 2,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,4,5,I can make the app which help writing. I can give some examples using drop down. Guided writing app was a very nice idea!,I personally think that there were many activities to do in one class. I think more opportunities to listen to the listening text and comprehend are needed.
6/18/24 20:55,Group 2,5,5,5,4,5,4,6,5,5,5,여러 language skills를 앱에 잘 녹여냈다.,"들어가야할 앱(ex. Google Form, Huggingface)이 한 가지 통로가 아니라서 아쉬웠다."
6/18/24 20:55,Group 2,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,4,6,학생들이 템플릿을 사용해서 이메일 쓰는 양식을 배워보도록 하는 부분이 인상깊었다.,
6/18/24 22:05,Group 2,6,4,5,5,5,5,6,5,4,6,Integration and Presentation were outstanding from this group's presentation.,"If their applications focus more on different skills not just focusing on writing, it will be more effective and useful. I liked most of their presentation, though. Especially, I liked how the teacher kept encouraging and tried to lead a bright atmosphere."
6/18/24 21:25,Group 3,4,5,4,5,4,6,5,5,4,6,"Again, I love the use of QR codes! I love the pre-listening phase as I think it does a good job of engaging the students and motivating them to want to hear the story. I like that you had a good variety of app use. I think it was a great idea to also include links to the apps in the powerpoint. The created AI video of the story was great to keep lower-level students engaged and to lower their affective filter as they may be less overwhelmed with the visual aspect. I love that the listening activity is broken into parts and can be broken down further even sentence by sentence for students who need it.","Is there a recent you chose British English as the voice for the flashcard app? In regards to the during listening, I actually think this could be combined with the ""guess the story with images"" activity. That modified activity would be more beneficial after a first listening or after the video listening. This is especially helpful for your intermediate-low students as it can't hurt to listen one more time. This would function as a general listening task before the comprehension activity which might be beneficial scaffolding that allows them to listen to the story one more time. Will students submit their feedback anonymously for lower affective filter? Some further modeling from the teacher or prompts for this activity might be helpful for the students' level but the Padlet looks great!!!!"

6/18/24 21:28,Group 3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"Vocabulary builder app was super good!!
It helped Ss build the vocab with some key words that are important for understanding the story.",Nothing. They were perfect! :)
6/18/24 21:28,Group 3,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,Ai video is fantastic. T's instruction was so clear and the lesson design is well structured.,"Sequencing activity , It would better with more clues for scaffolding."
6/18/24 21:29,Group 3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,The video was engaging! Every app was well-organized and meaningful. Well done!,"It looks like a very packed lesson. I know you guys put lots of efforts! But in reality, maybe narrowing down some elements in one lesson can be considered."
6/18/24 21:30,Group 3,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,5,5,4,인비디오로 재미있게 이야기를 만들어서 보여준것이 인상적이었습니다. 레벨이 낮은 학생들의 이목을 집중시키기에 좋았습니다. 또한 다른 어플들도 유용했습니다.,완전한 문장을 볼 기회가 생각보다 적었습니다. 비록 영상에서 완전한 문장이 제시되기는 하지만 긴호흡으로 글을 읽을 기회가 적었던것 같습니다.
6/18/24 21:30,Group 3,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,디지털 수업임에도 선생님과 학생의 활발한 상호작용,활동의 뚜렷한 목적성 필요
6/18/24 21:34,Group 3,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,5,6,6,Making AI video for listening text was a great idea. It could scaffold to understand the story for the lower level students.,"For the image ordering activity, the number of images were many, so the workload would be big for the students. I think it would be better to reduce the number of the images or students can do this activity with their partner collaboratively."
6/18/24 21:36,Group 3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"Especially, I liked Engagement, Integration, Accessibility of Group 3.","They would have been quite stressful as they were the last turn to finish the presentations, but everything seemed to work well. Nice work, all of you!:)"
6/11/24 21:34,Group 4,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,5,5,6,"It was great to use multimodal features in the app. Even though it was a grammar lesson, it covered listening and pronunciation extensively.",The cloze activity was a bit challenging. It would have been better with some hints or scaffolding. I'm not sure if grammar check without feedback is effective; maybe narrowing it down to checking past tense verbs and providing feedback together would be better.
6/11/24 21:34,Group 4,5,6,4,5,5,6,5,5,5,6,I loved that Ss could test their pronunciation with App2. The grammar checker was also really cool. I also loved the implementation of the QR code. Nice job!,"It might be a good idea to have more modelling and implement more interactive work. This was addressed in your presentation but I think the Listening cloze activity was a little difficult to follow. The directions say the Ss will hear the word but it appears to be a blank beep sound? And in general it might be hard for the Ss to do alone. In the lesson plan, it only mentions possible pair work in the post-listening. It might be a good idea to make the cloze activity or other activities as pair work."
6/11/24 21:35,Group 4,5,6,5,5,4,6,5,6,4,6,앱에 다양한 활동들을 담아 그것을 큐알코드로 제공해 아이들이 쉽게 접근할 수 있도록 한 것이 가장 인상적이었다.,

6/11/24 21:38,Group 4,4,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,5,Using their own apps to make the lesson more effective and dynamic,"But the links among activities are kind of weak. For example, I think practicing irregular past verb forms in text is more helpful than listening cloze test to do writing at the end of the lesson."
6/11/24 21:38,Group 4,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,Diverse apps! They look engaging! Great ideas for making apps.,"Clear instructions or revision will be needed for the listening cloze activity. Other than that, it was a great presentation! Thank you for sharing your hard work!"
