G1,R1,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Using Avartar throuth Voki is interesting and the management of class will be helpful for teachers.
G1,R2,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"It was great overall, but it would be better if they made a concrete lesson plan using Voki so that ."
G1,R3,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,"After listening to the presentation for the first time, I empathized with the points raised by the professor. From the perspective of an English instructor currently teaching elementary students, I believe that the website may be somewhat challenging for elementary students, and it may take considerable time for them to learn and become familiar with it.

Furthermore, I felt that the design and functionality of the website seemed somewhat disconnected from current AI technology. Given that elementary students nowadays encounter advanced technology at a younger age than my generation did, I didn't think the program would be particularly user-friendly for them.

Lastly, I was concerned that the imperfect pronunciation of the AI could lead young students to acquire incorrect pronunciation and accents at a young age.

While the AI in the presentation was intriguing and the content was well-organized and delivered, I had doubts about whether the chosen AI would be beneficial for today's students among the multitude of available AIs. Additionally, I felt that there were some shortcomings in terms of integrating TESOL into educational direction and utilizing lesson plans."
G1,R4,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Thanks for your presentation. I learned from your presentation that Voki can be a promising tool for students who are self-conscious or lack confidence. The procedures you provided were thoroughly explained with the help of screen captures, which greatly aided in my understanding how to use it. Personally, I found myself quite curious about how the class would be conducted using this tool. Seeing the complete design or having more detailed instructions would really pique my interest. Nevertheless, it was particularly insightful that they provided examples of the tool's various applications!"
G1,R5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Excellent use of the digital tool! The activity will be motivating to young learners.
G1,R6,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,It was a good presentation for me because I could get some information of Voki.
G1,R7,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Great job, my group mates! >.<"
G1,R8,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"I think 'Hangout forum' is very attractive. This helps students feel more comfortable and allows teachers to keep an eye on the discussions. Hangouts are good for getting students to talk and work together without feeling stressed, especially at the beginning of a class."
G1,R9,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,"Voki that Group 1 introduced seems to give Ss chances to interact with each other and with the website, which might be quite useful to be applied in class although it appears to be restricted to use in certain levels or ages. Nonetheless, their video and the md file were helpful enough to understand what they’re trying to say."
G1,R10,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Good job!
G1,R11,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"It was good, however for the young learners, giving concrete time might make the students nervous (e.g. discourse marker)"
G1,R12,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,It was good to know. Thank you for your nice presentation.
G1,R13,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Thank you for presenting in my absence!
G1,R14,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,"I understand what this is, and it is useful to release stress when beginners practice English, but it would be more efficient if they showed the various ways to adjust it to classes."
G2,R1,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Great Work!
G2,R2,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,It would be even better if they used more language-related approaches such as how to teach vocabulary from the text the tool created.
G2,R3,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,"While I acknowledge the importance of using AI-based websites and learning the technology behind them, I find myself trying to minimize my use of AI-based websites. The main reason for this is that I have come to realize that by relying too heavily on the convenience and simplicity of AI, I hinder my ability to foster creativity and critical thinking.

Students often dislike studying, especially when it comes to learning foreign languages, which is even less appealing than studying mathematics. While apps that generate books are convenient and offer educational benefits in terms of grammar, listening, and reading skills, they ultimately oversimplify the stages of studying and learning. Consequently, they may pose significant difficulties in acquiring creativity and writing skills."
G2,R4,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Thanks.
G2,R5,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,"The tool was very interesting and young learners would be very motivated because they can actually have an outcome. The presentation was also great! To make the activity more practical, you can give students more specific guidelines or instructions to follow!"
G2,R6,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Presentation organized well and introduced a good tool.
G2,R7,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,Its function as AI story + image creator can be useful for teaching kids. Thanks for letting us know about this tool.
G2,R8,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"In 'We Made a Story' tool, scaffolding techniques enhance students' creativity and engagement in writing tasks."
G2,R9,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,"It was interesting to see their approach that they used the topic, Fu Bao, the most well-loved and popular panda in Korea these days. However, from the perspective of learning/teaching English, using an AI story-maker tool for Ss to make their own stories doesn’t seem to be helpful for Ss to improve their skills to be creative by thinking in English and to interact with the other Ss and the tool itself. Especially, if Ts allow Ss to use any creation tool for their task creating something such as making a story or writing an essay, it might be able to make Ss be getting more dependent on using AI tools on their tasks. Those AI creation tools could be used when Ss compare and contrast their creation with that of AI tools’ in order to get some help in learning English."
G2,R10,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Thanks for introducing new tool! I want to use it in my writing class.
G2,R11,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"There should be additional activity related to the story, such as vocabulary activity or reading."
G2,R12,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Your visuals were effective in conveying key points.
G2,R13,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Great video!
G2,R14,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Through this, students can get an opportunity to get used to online tools ,and it looks fun making their own stories!"
G3,R1,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,It looks like Genially is helpful for teachers to prepare the materials. I want to try it.
G3,R2,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,"Overall good, but it would be even better if they showed us more detailed functions after selecting a few related to language teaching."
G3,R3,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,"The digital tool presented by Group 3 felt familiar to teachers yet seemed more like a tool for teachers rather than for students. It provides teachers with various tools that can be used during class time, but its usability for students seems limited, especially in terms of interaction between students and between students and teachers.

Additionally, the website gave the impression that it is more tailored for students to review and prepare on their own at home, rather than being directly integrated into classroom activities."
G3,R4,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,"Thanks for your presentation. The inclusion of numerous screen captures in the .md file greatly enhanced my understanding of Genially. The clear summary of its pros and cons also provided deeper insights. I was particularly impressed with the Gamification template section; I believe this feature will be highly effective in facilitating children's learning. Furthermore, given its use in children's education, I am eager to learn more about any potential account creation and login issues and the unique benefits this tool offers compared to Canva."
G3,R5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,Thanks for introducing a useful tool for teachers! It will lessen teachers' work for an effective class!
G3,R6,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"explained about the potential problem and the solution, so we could understand how we fix the problem."
G3,R7,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,"Your md file gives much better information than the video file. It give useful information of how to use it in different ways. But, I don't think it's fair to upload it later, after seeing all other groups' work and presentation."
G3,R8,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"The platform 'Genially' offers versatile content creation, rich multimedia integration, real-time collaboration and feedback, and ensures accessibility for diverse learners. 
Also, Genially is particularly useful for adapting to diverse learning styles and levels, making it easier to accommodate various cases."
G3,R9,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,"We shared ideas to decide “Genially” for our tool to introduce. Bori Choi (I) made the script for the PPT and presentation, and Hanna Jang the PPT Slides, and Jiwoo Han the Video clip, and Junhyung Park was in charge of the Presentation. Also, Hanna Jang and Bori Choi (I) did the MD file. Each of the group members did his/her job, but Hanna Jang especially worked hard and was most punctual, cooperative to work with."
G3,R10,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,It was really interesting to use text to speech tools.
G3,R11,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,I think It was useful tool for teacher.
G3,R12,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"Overall, good work! Keep up the good effort."
G3,R13,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,I've used this tool before so it was interesting to see how another group would use it. It's great for interactive content in the classroom!
G3,R14,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"At first, It was a little bit unclear about how to use it, but that looks nice tool for organizing classes and I'd like to try it in my class some day."
G4,R1,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,I like your video presentation!
G4,R2,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,It was such a fantastic job!:)
G4,R3,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,"Unlike other groups, we used three different apps. Firstly, we focused on teaching students how to integrate different types of apps and emphasized whether children can practically learn using digital apps.

Firstly, using ChatGPT helped students understand difficult news articles by summarizing the content with words suitable for their level. Secondly, utilizing Leonardo AI enabled children to create appropriate illustrations for the news, demonstrating their comprehension of the content. Lastly, ElevenLabs allowed students to listen to news summaries with accurate pronunciation, which could be integrated into discussion and presentation classes.

While the use of digital tools is essential rather than optional, I don't believe it necessarily leads to reducing the steps of learning or minimizing education. Additionally, as other teachers have pointed out, while these digital tools may not currently provide excellent results, I think that using them in lessons will undoubtedly be helpful to students once better versions of AI are available in the future."
G4,R4,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,"Thanks for your presentation. First, I was impressed by the integration of three trendy tools into a single lesson. The lesson plan was well-structured and easy to follow. It was beneficial to see the functions and examples of each tool demonstrated, and the in-depth explanation of the rationale provided valuable insights. During the presentation, I found myself curious about the the target learner's age and skill level, as well as how the prompt training would be implemented. The ideas presented were thought-provoking. Thank you!"
G4,R5,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,"Great presentation! I like the character talking very naturally with some gestures in the video. It seemed like a real person! The idea of using 3 tools for the lesson was well organized. By the way, I'm not sure the summary would be comprehensible to young learners even though it is summarized by GPT. I think you can add more prompt to adjust the level of the input when you use GPT! Except for this point, it was well-planned lesson!"
G4,R6,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"Introduced various tools, but all of them seem not easy to use."
G4,R7,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"The information you gave in the md file and the video was solid. Drawing out different functions from each AI tool looks creative, but I think just letting students use Chatgpt to create their writing entirely is not a good idea to improve their critical thinking. Instead, the teacher should give a lesson about the topic fully, and then teach students how to use Chatgpt critically for their writing as assistance. I assume that you mean to use it this way, but it seems your explanation lacks information about 'how to teach students to use AI well'."
G4,R8,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"The tools offer personalized learning, cooperative collaboration, and student-created materials for English learning. They also facilitate group work but may face challenges with content alignment and image consistency. And the example about image consistency was particularly striking."
G4,R9,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,"It was very interesting to see three AI tools for the middle school students to enhance their comprehension, summarization, and presentation skills. The second tool, Leonardo AI to create images must be helpful for Ss to save some time when the third tool, ElevenLabs to convert simplified text into audio must support auditory learning and enhance presentation skills as it is explained in their introduction. However, using ChatGPT for Ss to summarize news articles looks very possible to reduce chances to improve their critical thinking, vocabulary, or grammar and syntax skills by summarizing. That’s why it seems too early yet to use AI tools instead of Ss’ creation unless there are enough systematic educational plans from my personal views."
G4,R10,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,The idea to incorporate three AI tools is really impressive! I want to apply it in my class.
G4,R11,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,This lesson plan would reinforce our students to be professional L2 writers.
G4,R12,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Well done on organizing your ideas logically.
G4,R13,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,I love how you showed how to integrate more than one digital tool!
G4,R14,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,"One thing different from others is they tried to integrate various tools to organize a class. It's clear to understand, but using chat GPT4 would not be easy to use it right now because we have to pay for it."
