## Course syllabus

üî∏Course overview:  

This course is designed for TESOL graduate students to equip them with critical digital literacy skills and an understanding of technology's evolving role in language education. Recognizing the indispensability of digital tools in today‚Äôs educational landscape, the curriculum extends beyond traditional digital literacy to include basic coding skills essential for designing and developing learner-centered language apps. Students will gain hands-on experience in coding, enabling them to create customized, interactive language learning tools. This approach aims to empower educators to not only navigate but also innovate within the digital era of language teaching. By the end of the course, participants will be adept at integrating coding skills in pedagogically sound ways, enhancing both their teaching practices and their students‚Äô learning experiences.


üî∏Key Objectives:  

1. **Understanding Digital Literacy**: We begin by exploring the concept of digital literacy, particularly its importance for language educators in the 21st century. Students will learn about the evolving landscape of digital technology in education and how it impacts language teaching and learning.

2. **Basic Coding Skills**: Recognizing the growing relevance of coding in educational contexts, the course provides an introduction to basic coding skills. This foundational knowledge will enable TESOL educators to understand and utilize various digital platforms and tools more effectively.

3. **Learner-Centered Digital Tools**: A significant part of the course is dedicated to identifying and utilizing digital tools for creating learner-centered or customized teaching materials. Students will learn to assess and apply these tools to design engaging and effective language learning experiences.

4. **Application Development for Language Learning**: The course will introduce simple methods of developing applications tailored to language learning. This includes an overview of user-friendly platforms that do not require advanced coding skills, enabling educators to create interactive and immersive learning environments.

5. **Exploring Contemporary AI Tools**: With the advent of AI in education, this course provides an insight into how AI tools can be leveraged in language teaching. We will explore current AI technologies, their applications in language education, and how they can benefit both teachers and learners.

6. **Ethical Considerations and Digital Citizenship**: As educators in the digital age, understanding the ethical implications of technology use in the classroom is crucial. This course will cover aspects of digital citizenship, privacy, and ethical use of digital resources in education.

By the end of this course, TESOL graduates will be well-equipped with the fundamental skills and knowledge to effectively incorporate digital literacy into their teaching practices. They will be prepared to navigate the digital landscape of language education, creating innovative, inclusive, and effective learning experiences for their students.

## Course assignments

üîµ Mini-Project #1: Digital Tool for In-Class Activity (A guide video)

[Useful Tools to share](https://github.com/MK316/Spring2024/blob/main/DLTESOL/tools.md)


+ Objective: In groups, students will create a 3 to 5-minute video clip that showcases how to integrate available digital tools into in-class activities. The goal is to share innovative methods for enhancing language learning through technology and to evaluate the technologies with which teachers are already familiar. (The purpose is to share the idea with your colleagues.)
+ Requirements:
  + Select digital tools (at least one) that are applicable to TESOL settings.
  + Design an in-class activity (one or two) that effectively incorporates the chosen digital tools. (How about we think about the activities traditionally done in language learning and consider how we can adapt them into classroom activities suitable for the digital age?)
  + Produce a 3 to 5-minute video presenting (guiding) the activity, highlighting its learning objectives, implementation steps (if relevant), and expected outcomes (advantages/benefits).
  + Address advantages/disadvantages/limitations (if relevant) while you're using the tool for the chosen activity.
  + Share the video [here](https://padlet.com/mirankim316/introduction-to-coding-and-language-app-design-tesol-spring--njwe895ytgl83hhu) (Due by Apr.15 before our class); this is our outcome for future references; you can also share the video with other colleagues later on.
  + You'll be giving a presentation in class (Apr.9); basically the same material with the video but the presentation will give us to share our ideas together in class. (Students will have a chance to review the video before the class. This is why the deadline for the video is Apr.15) 

üîµ Mini-project #2: Language Learning App Development
+ Objective: Groups will design language learning activities and then use Python to code and develop a functional language learning application based on these activities.
+ Requirements:
  + Conceptualize a set of language learning activities suitable for TESOL students.
  + Ensure the activities are interactive, user-friendly, and educational.
  + Provide a brief documentation explaining the app‚Äôs features, usage instructions, and learning goals.

üîµ Final project: Lesson Demonstration with Language Apps
+ Utilizing the language applications and digital tools developed earlier, students will conduct a preview of a comprehensive lesson demonstration. This project aims to showcase the practical application of their created tools in a real-world teaching scenario. These assignments are designed to foster creativity, collaboration, and technical skills, preparing students for the digital demands of contemporary language teaching. Details will be announced in time.
