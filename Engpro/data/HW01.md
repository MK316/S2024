오늘은 2024. ___월 ____일이고, 제 이름은 ________ 입니다.


제목: 무지개 이야기


대기 중에 있는 태양빛이 빗방울에 부딪힐 때, 빗방울은 프리즘처럼 작용하여 무지개를 형성합니다. 무지개는 하얀 빛이 많은 아름다운 색상으로 나뉘어지는 현상입니다. 이 색상들은 길고 둥근 아치 형태를 취하며, 그 궤적은 하늘 높이에 걸쳐 있고, 보통 양 끝은 지평선 너머에 있는 것처럼 보이게 됩니다. 한 전설에 따르면, 무지개의 한쪽 끝에는 무언가를 끓이고 있는 황금 냄비가 있다고 합니다. 많은 사람들이 그것을 찾아보고자 했지만, 지금까지 그것을 발견한 사람은 없습니다. 어떤 사람이 자신의 손에 닿지 않는 것을 찾으려 할 때, 우리는 그 사람이 무지개 끝의 황금 냄비를 찾고 있다고 비유하기도 합니다. 수세기 동안 사람들은 무지개를 여러 가지 방식으로 설명해 왔습니다. 어떤 이들은 무지개를 물리적 설명 없이 기적이라고 받아들였습니다. 예를 들어, 히브리인들에게 무지개는 더 이상 홍수가 없을 것이라는 표시가 되기도 했습니다. 그리스인들은 신들이 전쟁이나 큰 비를 예고하기 위해 보내는 신호로 상상했습니다. 또한 노르웨이인들은 신들이 지상에서 하늘에 있는 그들의 집으로 돌아가는 다리로 여겼습니다. 이와 다르게 어떤 이들은 무지개 현상을 물리적으로 설명하려고 시도했습니다. 아리스토텔레스는 무지개가 비에 의한 태양 광선의 반사로 인해 발생한다고 주장하였습니다. 나중에 물리학자들은 반사가 아니라 빗방울에 의한 굴절이 무지개를 일으키는 원인이라는 것을 알아냈습니다. 이렇듯 무지개에 대해 많은 복잡한 생각들이 형성되어 왔습니다. 무지개의 차이는 상당 부분이 빗방울의 크기에 따라 다르며, 빗방울의 크기가 커질수록 색 영역의 폭이 넓어집니다. 실제로 관찰되는 무지개는 여러 개의 무지개가 중첩되는 효과라고 합니다. 두 번째 무지개의 빨간색이 첫 번째 무지개의 초록색과 겹칠 때, 결과적으로 보통과 다른 넓은 노란색 대를 가진 무지개가 형성되는데, 이는 빨간색과 초록색 빛이 섞일 때 노란색을 형성하기 때문입니다. 이것은 주로 빨간색과 노란색이 도드라지고, 초록색이나 파란색은 거의 또는 전혀 없는 매우 흔한 유형의 무지개입니다.

## Recording 03. Reading passage (the rainbow passage)
* Read aloud the story a couple of times so that you get the general meaning of the passage. Then record your reading for submission. (LMS)

When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun’s rays by the rain. Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
