# 🌿 Graduate Seminar (1 Credit, Spring 2024)

**Course Description:**

This one-credit Graduate Seminar in Frequency Data Analysis focuses on key statistical concepts and techniques for handling frequency data. Participants will learn how to analyze and interpret frequency data, apply descriptive statistics, conduct hypothesis testing using the Chi-squared test, and leverage Python as a tool for data analysis.

**By the end of this seminar, students will be able to:**

1. Analyze and interpret frequency data effectively.
2. Apply descriptive statistics to summarize, visualize and communicate findings.
3. Conduct hypothesis testing using the Chi-squared test and Python.
