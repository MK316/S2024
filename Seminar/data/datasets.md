## Dataset 1
Null Hypothesis: The null hypothesis states that there is no association between age groups and their preferences for electronic bicycles. Specifically, the hypothesis can be expressed as:

+ðŸ”Ž H0: Age group (Teens, Adults, Seniors) is independent of the preference for electronic bicycles (Likes, Dislikes).
This hypothesis implies that the preference for electronic bicycles does not vary with age; in other words, each age group is equally likely to like or dislike electronic bicycles, and any observed difference in preferences across age groups is due to random variation.
+ðŸ”Ž HA: There is a dependence between age group and preference for electronic bicycles.

## Dataset 2

+ðŸ”Ž H0: There is no association between students' study majors (Science, Engineering, Humanities) and their interest in online courses (Interested, Not Interested).
+ðŸ”Ž HA: There is an association between students' study majors and their interest in online courses.

## Dataset 3

+ðŸ”Ž Null hypothesis: _There is no association between students' study majors (Science, Engineering, Humanities) and their interest in online courses (Interested, Not Interested)._
+ðŸ”Ž Alternative hypothesis: _There is an association between students' study majors and their interest in online courses._
