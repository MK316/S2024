The human voice Its the instrument we all play Its the most powerful sound in the world probably Its the only one that can start a war or say I love you And yet many people have the experience that when they speak people dont listen to them And why is that How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world What Id like to suggest there are a number of habits that we need to move away from Ive assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking Im not pretending this is an exhaustive list but these seven I think are pretty large habits that we can all fall into First gossip Speaking ill of somebody whos not present Not a nice habit and we know perfectly well the person gossiping five minutes later will be gossiping about us Second judging We know people who are like this in conversation and its very hard to listen to somebody if you know that youre being judged and found wanting at the same time Third negativity You can fall into this My mother in the last years of her life became very negative and its hard to listen I remember one day I said to her Its October 1 today and she said I know isnt it dreadful Its hard to listen when somebodys that negative And another form of negativity complaining Well this is the national art of the UK Its our national sport We complain about the weather sport about politics about everything but actually complaining is viral misery Its not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world Excuses Weve all met this guy Maybe weve all been this guy Some people have a blamethrower They just pass it on to everybody else and dont take responsibility for their actions and again hard to listen to somebody who is being like that Penultimate the sixth of the seven embroidery exaggeration It demeans our language actually sometimes For example if I see something that really is awesome what do I call it And then of course this exaggeration becomes lying and we dont want to listen to people we know are lying to us And finally dogmatism The confusion of facts with opinions When those two things get conflated youre listening into the wind You know somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true Its difficult to listen to that So here they are seven deadly sins of speaking These are things I think we need to avoid But is there a positive way to think about this Yes there is Id like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones foundations that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world Fortunately these things spell a word The word is hail and it has a great definition as well Im not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head Im talking about this definition to greet or acclaim enthusiastically which is how I think our words will be received if we stand on these four things So what do they stand for See if you can guess The H honesty of course being true in what you say being straight and clear The A is authenticity just being yourself A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth which I think is a lovely way to put it The I is integrity being your word actually doing what you say and being somebody people can trust And the L is love I dont mean romantic love but I do mean wishing people well for two reasons First of all I think absolute honesty may not be what we want I mean my goodness you look ugly this morning Perhaps thats not necessary Tempered with love of course honesty is a great thing But also if youre really wishing somebody well its very hard to judge them at the same time Im not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously So hail Also now thats what you say and its like the old song it is what you say its also the way that you say it You have an amazing toolbox This instrument is incredible and yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened Id like to have a little rummage in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play with which will increase the power of your speaking Register for example Now falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time but theres a register in between Im not going to get very technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches You can locate your voice however So if I talk up here in my nose you can hear the difference If I go down here in my throat which is where most of us speak from most of the time But if you want weight you need to go down here to the chest You hear the difference We vote for politicians with lower voices its true because we associate depth with power and with authority Thats register Then we have timbre Its the way your voice feels Again the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich smooth warm like hot chocolate Well if thats not you thats not the end of the world because you can train Go and get a voice coach And there are amazing things you can do with breathing with posture and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice Then prosody I love prosody This is the singsong the metalanguage that we use in order to impart meaning Its root one for meaning in conversation People who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they dont have any prosody at all Thats where the word monotonic comes from or monotonous monotone Also we have repetitive prosody now coming in where every sentence ends as if it were a question when its actually not a question its a statement And if you repeat that one its actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody which I think is a shame so lets try and break that habit Pace I can get very excited by saying something really quickly or I can slow right down to emphasize and at the end of that of course is our old friend silence Theres nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk is there We dont have to fill it with ums and ahs It can be very powerful Of course pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal but you can do it just with pitch Where did you leave my keys Where did you leave my keys So slightly different meaning in those two deliveries And finally volume I can get really excited by using volume Sorry about that if I startled anybody Or I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet Some people broadcast the whole time Try not to do that Thats called sodcasting Imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately Not nice Of course where this all comes into play most of all is when youve got something really important to do It might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people It might be proposing marriage asking for a raise a wedding speech Whatever it is if its really important you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that its going to work on and no engine works well without being warmed up Warm up your voice Actually let me show you how to do that Would you all like to stand up for a moment Im going to show you the six vocal warmup exercises that I do before every talk I ever do Any time youre going to talk to anybody important do these First arms up deep breath in and sigh out ahhhhh like that One more time Ahhhh very good Now were going to warm up our lips and were going to go Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Ba Very good And now brrrrrrrrrr just like when you were a kid Brrrr Now your lips should be coming alive Were going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la la la la la la la la la Beautiful Youre getting really good at this And then roll an R Rrrrrrr Thats like champagne for the tongue Finally and if I can only do one the pros call this the siren Its really good It starts with we and goes to aw The we is high the aw is low So you go weeeaawww weeeaawww Fantastic Give yourselves a round of applause Take a seat thank you Next time you speak do those in advance Now let me just put this in context to close This is a serious point here This is where we are now right We speak not very well to people who simply arent listening in an environment thats all about noise and bad acoustics I have talked about that on this stage in different phases What would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who were listening consciously in environments which were actually fit for purpose Or to make that a bit larger what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound That would be a world that does sound beautiful and one where understanding would be the norm and that is an idea worth spreading Thank youWhen I was a kid the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war Thats why we had a barrel like this down in our basement filled with cans of food and water When the nuclear attack came we were supposed to go downstairs hunker down and eat out of that barrel Today the greatest risk of global catastrophe doesnt look like this Instead it looks like this If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades its most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war Not missiles but microbes Now part of the reason for this is that weve invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents But weve actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic Were not ready for the next epidemic Lets look at Ebola Im sure all of you read about it in the newspaper lots of tough challenges I followed it carefully through the case analysis tools we use to track polio eradication And as you look at what went on the problem wasnt that there was a system that didnt work well enough the problem was that we didnt have a system at all In fact theres some pretty obvious key missing pieces We didnt have a group of epidemiologists ready to go who would have gone seen what the disease was seen how far it had spread The case reports came in on paper It was very delayed before they were put online and they were extremely inaccurate We didnt have a medical team ready to go We didnt have a way of preparing people Now Médecins Sans Frontières did a great job orchestrating volunteers But even so we were far slower than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these countries And a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers There was no one there to look at treatment approaches No one to look at the diagnostics No one to figure out what tools should be used As an example we could have taken the blood of survivors processed it and put that plasma back in people to protect them But that was never tried So there was a lot that was missing And these things are really a global failure The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics but not to do these things I talked about Now in the movies its quite different Theres a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go they move in they save the day but thats just pure Hollywood The failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically more devastating than Ebola Lets look at the progression of Ebola over this year About 10000 people died and nearly all were in the three West African countries Theres three reasons why it didnt spread more The first is that there was a lot of heroic work by the health workers They found the people and they prevented more infections The second is the nature of the virus Ebola does not spread through the air And by the time youre contagious most people are so sick that theyre bedridden Third it didnt get into many urban areas And that was just luck If it had gotten into a lot more urban areas the case numbers would have been much larger So next time we might not be so lucky You can have a virus where people feel well enough while theyre infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market The source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like Ebola or it could be bioterrorism So there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse In fact lets look at a model of a virus spread through the air like the Spanish Flu back in 1918 So heres what would happen It would spread throughout the world very very quickly And you can see over 30 million people died from that epidemic So this is a serious problem We should be concerned But in fact we can build a really good response system We have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here Weve got cell phones to get information from the public and get information out to them We have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where theyre moving We have advances in biology that should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a pathogen and be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen So we can have tools but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system And we need preparedness The best lessons I think on how to get prepared are again what we do for war For soldiers we have fulltime waiting to go We have reserves that can scale us up to large numbers NATO has a mobile unit that can deploy very rapidly NATO does a lot of war games to check are people well trained Do they understand about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies So they are absolutely ready to go So those are the kinds of things we need to deal with an epidemic What are the key pieces First we need strong health systems in poor countries Thats where mothers can give birth safely kids can get all their vaccines But also where well see the outbreak very early on We need a medical reserve corps lots of people whove got the training and background who are ready to go with the expertise And then we need to pair those medical people with the military taking advantage of the militarys ability to move fast do logistics and secure areas We need to do simulations germ games not war games so that we see where the holes are The last time a germ game was done in the United States was back in 2001 and it didnt go so well So far the score is germs 1 people 0 Finally we need lots of advanced RD in areas of vaccines and diagnostics There are some big breakthroughs like the Adenoassociated virus that could work very very quickly Now I dont have an exact budget for what this would cost but Im quite sure its very modest compared to the potential harm The World Bank estimates that if we have a worldwide flu epidemic global wealth will go down by over three trillion dollars and wed have millions and millions of deaths These investments offer significant benefits beyond just being ready for the epidemic The primary healthcare the RD those things would reduce global health equity and make the world more just as well as more safe So I think this should absolutely be a priority Theres no need to panic We dont have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down into the basement But we need to get going because time is not on our side In fact if theres one positive thing that can come out of the Ebola epidemic its that it can serve as an early warning a wakeup call to get ready If we start now we can be ready for the next epidemic Thank youWhat makes a great leader today Many of us carry this image of this allknowing superhero who stands and commands and protects his followers But thats kind of an image from another time and whats also outdated are the leadership development programs that are based on success models for a world that was not a world that is or that is coming We conducted a study of 4000 companies and we asked them lets see the effectiveness of your leadership development programs Fiftyeight percent of the companies cited significant talent gaps for critical leadership roles That means that despite corporate training programs offsites assessments coaching all of these things more than half the companies had failed to grow enough great leaders You may be asking yourself is my company helping me to prepare to be a great 21stcentury leader The odds are probably not Now Ive spent 25 years of my professional life observing what makes great leaders Ive worked inside Fortune 500 companies Ive advised over 200 CEOs and Ive cultivated more leadership pipelines than you can imagine But a few years ago I noticed a disturbing trend in leadership preparation I noticed that despite all the efforts there were familiar stories that kept resurfacing about individuals One story was about Chris a highpotential superstar leader who moves to a new unit and fails destroying unrecoverable value And then there were stories like Sidney the CEO who was so frustrated because her company is cited as a best company for leaders but only one of the top 50 leaders is equipped to lead their crucial initiatives And then there were stories like the senior leadership team of a oncethriving business thats surprised by a market shift finds itself having to force the company to reduce its size in half or go out of business Now these recurring stories cause me to ask two questions Why are the leadership gaps widening when theres so much more investment in leadership development And what are the great leaders doing distinctly different to thrive and grow One of the things that I did I was so consumed by these questions and also frustrated by those stories that I left my job so that I could study this full time and I took a year to travel to different parts of the world to learn about effective and ineffective leadership practices in companies countries and nonprofit organizations And so I did things like travel to South Africa where I had an opportunity to understand how Nelson Mandela was ahead of his time in anticipating and navigating his political social and economic context I also met a number of nonprofit leaders who despite very limited financial resources were making a huge impact in the world often bringing together seeming adversaries And I spent countless hours in presidential libraries trying to understand how the environment had shaped the leaders the moves that they made and then the impact of those moves beyond their tenure And then when I returned to work full time in this role I joined with wonderful colleagues who were also interested in these questions Now from all this I distilled the characteristics of leaders who are thriving and what they do differently and then I also distilled the preparation practices that enable people to grow to their potential I want to share some of those with you now In a 21stcentury world which is more global digitally enabled and transparent with faster speeds of information flow and innovation and where nothing big gets done without some kind of a complex matrix relying on traditional development practices will stunt your growth as a leader In fact traditional assessments like narrow 360 surveys or outdated performance criteria will give you false positives lulling you into thinking that you are more prepared than you really are Leadership in the 21st century is defined and evidenced by three questions Where are you looking to anticipate the next change to your business model or your life The answer to this question is on your calendar Who are you spending time with On what topics Where are you traveling What are you reading And then how are you distilling this into understanding potential discontinuities and then making a decision to do something right now so that youre prepared and ready Theres a leadership team that does a practice where they bring together each member collecting here are trends that impact me here are trends that impact another team member and they share these and then make decisions to coursecorrect a strategy or to anticipate a new move Great leaders are not headdown They see around corners shaping their future not just reacting to it The second question is what is the diversity measure of your personal and professional stakeholder network You know we hear often about good ol boy networks and theyre certainly alive and well in many institutions But to some extent we all have a network of people that were comfortable with So this question is about your capacity to develop relationships with people that are very different than you And those differences can be biological physical functional political cultural socioeconomic And yet despite all these differences they connect with you and they trust you enough to cooperate with you in achieving a shared goal Great leaders understand that having a more diverse network is a source of pattern identification at greater levels and also of solutions because you have people that are thinking differently than you are Third question are you courageous enough to abandon a practice that has made you successful in the past Theres an expression Go along to get along But if you follow this advice chances are as a leader youre going to keep doing whats familiar and comfortable Great leaders dare to be different They dont just talk about risktaking they actually do it And one of the leaders shared with me the fact that the most impactful development comes when you are able to build the emotional stamina to withstand people telling you that your new idea is naïve or reckless or just plain stupid Now interestingly the people who will join you are not your usual suspects in your network Theyre often people that think differently and therefore are willing to join you in taking a courageous leap And its a leap not a step More than traditional leadership programs answering these three questions will determine your effectiveness as a 21stcentury leader So what makes a great leader in the 21st century Ive met many and they stand out They are women and men who are preparing themselves not for the comfortable predictability of yesterday but also for the realities of today and all of those unknown possibilities of tomorrow Thank youHi My name is Cameron Russell and for the last little while Ive been a model Actually for 10 years And I feel like theres an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress So luckily I brought an outfit change This is the first outfit change on the TED stage so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it I think If some of the women were really horrified when I came out you dont have to tell me now but Ill find out later on Twitter Id also note that Im quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds Not everybody gets to do that These heels are very uncomfortable so good thing I wasnt going to wear them The worst part is putting this sweater over my head because thats when youll all laugh at me so dont do anything while its over my head All right So why did I do that That was awkward Well  Hopefully not as awkward as that picture Image is powerful but also image is superficial I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds And in this picture I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guys hair And of course barring surgery or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work theres very little that we can do to transform how we look and how we look though it is superficial and immutable has a huge impact on our lives So today for me being fearless means being honest And I am on this stage because I am a model I am on this stage because I am a pretty white woman and in my industry we call that a sexy girl Im going to answer the questions that people always ask me but with an honest twist So the first question is how do you become a model I always just say Oh I was scouted but that means nothing The real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery and I am the recipient of a legacy and maybe youre wondering what is a legacy Well for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that were biologically programmed to admire but also as tall slender figures and femininity and white skin And this is a legacy that was built for me and its a legacy that Ive been cashing out on And I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point and maybe there are some fashionistas who are like Wait Naomi Tyra Joan Smalls Liu Wen And first I commend you on your model knowledge Very impressive But unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 a very inspired NYU PhD student counted all the models on the runway every single one that was hired and of the 677 models that were hired only 27 or less than four percent were nonwhite The next question people always ask is Can I be a model when I grow up And the first answer is I dont know they dont put me in charge of that But the second answer and what I really want to say to these little girls is Why You know You can be anything You could be the President of the United States or the inventor of the next Internet or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet which would be awesome because youd be the first one If after this amazing list they still are like No no Cameron I want to be a model well then I say Be my boss Because Im not in charge of anything and you could be the editor in chief of American Vogue or the CEO of HampM or the next Steven Meisel Saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up Its out of your control and its awesome and its not a career path I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons it can just be distilled right now So if the photographer is right there the light is right there like a nice HMI and the client says We want a walking shot this leg goes first nice and long this arm goes back this arm goes forward the head is at three quarters and you just go back and forth just do that and then you look back at your imaginary friends 300 400 500 times It will look something like this Hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle That was  I dont know what happened there Unfortunately after youve gone to school and you have a résumé and youve done a few jobs you cant say anything anymore so if you say you want to be the President of the United States but your résumé reads Underwear Model 10 years people give you a funny look The next question is Do they retouch all the photos And yeah they pretty much retouch all the photos but that is only a small component of whats happening This picture is the very first picture that I ever took and its also the very first time that I had worn a bikini and I didnt even have my period yet I know were getting personal but I was a young girl This is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier Heres me on the same day as this shoot My friend got to come Heres me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue Heres me on the soccer team and in V Magazine And heres me today And I hope what youre seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me They are constructions and they are constructions by a group of professionals by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and preproduction and postproduction and they build this Thats not me Okay so the next question people always ask me is Do you get free stuff I do have too many 8inch heels which I never get to wear except for earlier but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life and thats what we dont like to talk about I grew up in Cambridge and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free When I was a teenager I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course we got pulled over and all it took was a Sorry officer and we were on our way And I got these free things because of how I look not who I am and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are I live in New York and last year of the 140000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked 86 of them were black and Latino and most of them were young men And there are only 177000 young black and Latino men in New York so for them its not a question of Will I get stopped but How many times will I get stopped When will I get stopped When I was researching this talk I found out that of the 13yearold girls in the United States 53 dont like their bodies and that number goes to 78 by the time that theyre 17 So the last question people ask me is What is it like to be a model And I think the answer that theyre looking for is If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair you will be so happy and fabulous And when were backstage we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that We say Its really amazing to travel and its amazing to get to work with creative inspired passionate people And those things are true but theyre only one half of the story because the thing that we never say on camera that I have never said on camera is I am insecure And Im insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day And if you ever are wondering If I have thinner thighs and shinier hair will I be happier you just need to meet a group of models because they have the thinnest thighs the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes and theyre the most physically insecure women probably on the planet When I was writing this talk I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance because on the one hand I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say Look Ive received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with and it doesnt always make me happy But mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when I am one of the biggest beneficiaries But Im also happy and honored to be up here and I think that its great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and Id had more agency in my career because maybe then I wouldnt tell the story of how I got my first job or maybe I wouldnt tell the story of how I paid for college which seems so important right now If theres a takeaway to this talk I hope its that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures Thank youI was hoping today to talk a little bit about creativity You know a lot of people really struggle to give themselves permission to be creative And reasonably so I mean were all a little suspect of our own talent And I remember a story I came across in my early 20s that kind of meant a lot to me I was really into Allen Ginsberg and I was reading his poetry and I was reading  he did a lot of interviews  and one time William F Buckley had this television program called Firing Line and Ginsberg went on there and sang a Hare Krishna song while playing the harmonium And he got back to New York to all his intelligentsia friends and they all told him Dont you know that everybody thinks youre an idiot and the whole countrys making fun of you And he said Thats my job Im a poet and Im going to play the fool Most people have to go to work all day long and they come home and they fight with their spouse and they eat and they turn on the old boob tube and somebody tries to sell them something and I just screwed all that up I went on and I sang about Krishna and now theyre sitting in bed and going Who is this stupid poet And they cant fall asleep right And thats his job as a poet And so I find that very liberating because I think that most of us really want to offer the world something of quality something that the world will consider good or important And thats really the enemy because its not up to us whether what we do is any good and if history has taught us anything the world is an extremely unreliable critic Right So you have to ask yourself Do you think human creativity matters Well hmm Most people dont spend a lot of time thinking about poetry Right They have a life to live and theyre not really that concerned with Allen Ginsbergs poems or anybodys poems until their father dies they go to a funeral you lose a child somebody breaks your heart they dont love you anymore and all of a sudden youre desperate for making sense out of this life and Has anybody ever felt this bad before How did they come out of this cloud Or the inverse  something great You meet somebody and your heart explodes You love them so much you cant even see straight You know youre dizzy Did anybody feel like this before What is happening to me And thats when arts not a luxury its actually sustenance We need it OK Well what is it Human creativity is nature manifest in us We look at the oh  the aurora borealis Right I did this movie called White Fang when I was a kid and we shot up in Alaska and you go out at night and the sky was like rippling with purple and pink and white and its the most beautiful thing I ever saw It really looked like the sky was playing Beautiful You go to Grand Canyon at sundown Its beautiful We know thats beautiful But fall in love Your lovers pretty beautiful I have four kids Watching them play Watching them pretend to be a butterfly or run around the house and doing anything its so beautiful And I believe that we are here on this star in space to try to help one another Right And first we have to survive and then we have to thrive And to thrive to express ourselves alright well heres the rub we have to know ourselves What do you love And if you get close to what you love who you are is revealed to you and it expands For me it was really easy I did my first professional play I was 12 years old I was in a play called Saint Joan by George Bernard Shaw at the McCarter Theatre and  boom  I was in love My world just expanded And that profession  Im almost 50 now  that profession has never stopped giving back to me and it gives back more and more mostly strangely through the characters that Ive played Ive played cops Ive played criminals Ive played priests Ive played sinners and the magic of this over a lifetime over 30 years of doing this is that you start to see that my experiences me Ethan is not nearly as unique as I thought I have so much in common with all these people And so they have something in common with me You start to see how connected we all are My greatgrandmother Della Hall Walker Green on her deathbed she wrote this little biography in the hospital and it was only about 36 pages long and she spent about five pages on the one time she did costumes for a play Her first husband got like a paragraph Cotton farming of which she did for 50 years gets a mention Five pages on doing these costumes And I look  my mom gave me one of her quilts that she made and you can feel it She was expressing herself and it has a power thats real I remember my stepbrother and I went to go see Top Gun whatever year that came out And I remember we walked out of the mall it was like blazing hot I just looked at him and we both felt that movie just like a calling from God You know Just  But completely differently Like I wanted to be an actor I was like Ive got to make something that makes people feel I just want to be a part of that And he wanted to be in the military Thats all we ever did was play FBI play army man play knights you know and Id like pose with my sword and he would build a working crossbow that you could shoot an arrow into a tree So he joins the army Well he just retired a colonel in the Green Berets Hes a multidecorated combat veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq He now teaches a sail camp for children of fallen soldiers He gave his life to his passion His creativity was leadership leading others his bravery to help others That was something he felt called to do and it gave back to him We know this  the time of our life is so short and how we spend it  are we spending it doing whats important to us Most of us not I mean its hard The pull of habit is so huge and thats what makes kids so beautifully creative is that they dont have any habits and they dont care if theyre any good or not right Theyre not building a sandcastle going I think Im going to be a really good sandcastle builder They just throw themselves at whatever project you put in front of them  dancing doing a painting building something any opportunity they have they try to use it to impress upon you their individuality Its so beautiful Its a thing that worries me sometimes whenever you talk about creativity because it can have this kind of feel that its just nice you know or its warm or its something pleasant Its not Its vital Its the way we heal each other In singing our song in telling our story in inviting you to say Hey listen to me and Ill listen to you were starting a dialogue And when you do that this healing happens and we come out of our corners and we start to witness each others common humanity We start to assert it And when we do that really good things happen So if you want to help your community if you want to help your family if you want to help your friends you have to express yourself And to express yourself you have to know yourself Its actually super easy You just have to follow your love There is no path Theres no path till you walk it and you have to be willing to play the fool So dont read the book that you should read read the book you want to read Dont listen to the music that you used to like Take some time to listen to some new music Take some time to talk to somebody that you dont normally talk to I guarantee if you do that you will feel foolish Thats the point Play the fool Well I want to go Austin and I wanna stay home Invite our friends over but still be alone Live for danger Play it cool Have everyone respect me for being a foolMy name is Tom and Ive come here today to come clean about what I do for money Basically I use my mouth in strange ways in exchange for cash I usually do this kind of thing in seedy downtown bars and on street corners so this mightnt be the most appropriate setting but Id like to give you guys a bit of a demonstration about what I do And now for my next number Id like to return to the classics Were going to take it back way back back into time ♫ Billie Jean is not my lover ♫ ♫ Shes just a girl who claims that I am the one ♫ ♫ But the kid is not my son ♫ All right Wassup Thank you very much TEDx If you guys havent figured it out already my names Tom Thum and Im a beatboxer which means all the sounds that you just heard were made entirely using just my voice and the only thing was my voice And I can assure you there are absolutely no effects on this microphone whatsoever And Im very very stoked — You guys are just applauding for everything Its great Look at this Mom I made it Im very very stoked to be here today representing my kinfolk and all those that havent managed to make a career out of an innate ability for inhuman noisemaking Because it is a bit of a niche market and theres not much work going on especially where Im from You know Im from Brisbane which is a great city to live in Yeah All right Most of Brisbanes here Thats good You know Im from Brizzy which is a great city to live in but lets be honest  its not exactly the cultural hub of the Southern Hemisphere So I do a lot of my work outside Brisbane and outside Australia and so the pursuit of this crazy passion of mine has enabled me to see so many amazing places in the world So Id like to share with you if I may my experiences So ladies and gentlemen I would like to take you on a journey throughout the continents and throughout sound itself We start our journey in the central deserts India China Germany Party party yeah And before we reach our final destination ladies and gentlemen I would like to share with you some technology that I brought all the way from the thriving metropolis of Brisbane These things in front of me here are called Kaoss Pads and they allow me to do a whole lot of different things with my voice For example the one on the left here allows me to add a little bit of reverb to my sound which gives me that   flavor And the other ones here I can use them in unison to mimic the effect of a drum machine or something like that I can sample in my own sounds and I can play it back just by hitting the pads here TEDx I got way too much time on my hands And last but not least the one on my right here allows me to loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop my voice So with all that in mind ladies and gentlemen I would like to take you on a journey to a completely separate part of Earth as I transform the Sydney Opera House into a smoky downtown jazz bar All right boys take it away Ladies and gentlemen Id like to introduce you to a very special friend of mine one of the greatest double bassists I know Mr Smokey Jefferson lets take it for a walk Come on baby All right ladies and gentlemen Id like to introduce you to the star of the show one of the greatest jazz legends of our time Music lovers and jazz lovers alike please give a warm hand of applause for the one and only Mr Peeping Tom Take it away Thank you Thank you very muchDo you think its possible to control someones attention Even more than that what about predicting human behavior I think those are interesting ideas For me that would be the perfect superpower actually kind of an evil way of approaching it But for myself in the past Ive spent the last 20 years studying human behavior from a rather unorthodox way picking pockets When we think of misdirection we think of something as looking off to the side when actually the things right in front of us are often the hardest to see the things that you look at every day that youre blinded to For example how many of you still have your cell phones on you right now Great Doublecheck Make sure you still have them I was doing some shopping before Youve looked at them a few times today but Ill ask you a question Without looking at it directly yet can you remember the icon in the bottom right corner Bring them out check and see how accurate you were Howd you do Show of hands Did we get it Now that youre done close them down Every phone has something in common No matter how you organize the icons you still have a clock on the front So without looking at your phone what time was it You just looked at your clock right Interesting idea Lets take that a step further with a game of trust Close your eyes I realize Im asking you to do that while you just heard theres a pickpocket in the room but close your eyes Now youve been watching me for about 30 seconds With your eyes closed what am I wearing Make your best guess What color is my shirt What color is my tie Now open your eyes Show of hands were you right Interesting isnt it Some of us are a little bit more perceptive than others it seems But I have a different theory about that model of attention They have fancy models of attention Posners trinity model of attention For me I like to think of it very simple like a surveillance system Its kind of like you have all these fancy sensors and inside your brain is a little security guard For me I like to call him Frank So Frank is sitting at a desk Hes got lots of cool information in front of him hightech equipment hes got cameras hes got a little phone that he can pick up listen to the ears all these senses all these perceptions But attention is what steers your perceptions its what controls your reality Its the gateway to the mind If you dont attend to something you cant be aware of it But ironically you can attend to something without being aware of it For example the cocktail effect Youre in a party having conversations with someone and yet you can recognize your name without realizing you were listening to that Now for my job I have to play with techniques to exploit this to play with your attention as a limited resource So if I could control how you spend your attention if I could maybe steal your attention through a distraction Now instead of doing it like misdirection and throwing it off to the side instead what I choose to focus on is Frank to be able to play with the Frank inside your head your security guard and get you instead of focusing on your external senses just to go internal for a second So if I ask you to access a memory like what is that What just happened Do you have a wallet Do you have an American Express in your wallet And when I do that your Frank turns around He accesses the file He has to rewind the tape Whats interesting is he cant rewind the tape at the same time that hes trying to process new data This sounds like a good theory but I could talk for a long time tell you lots of things and a portion of them may be true but I think its better if I tried to show that to you here live If I come down Im going to do a bit of shopping Just hold still where you are Hello how are you Its lovely to see you Wonderful job onstage Lovely watch it doesnt

friends Joe thank you very much So same question I asked you before but this time you dont have to close your eyes What am I wearing Audience Oh Attention is a powerful thing Like I said it shapes your reality So I guess Id like to pose that question to you If you could control somebodys attention what would you do with it Thank youWhen I was 27 years old I left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding teaching I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools And like any teacher I made quizzes and tests I gave out homework assignments When the work came back I calculated grades What struck me was that IQ was not the only difference between my best and my worst students Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores Some of my smartest kids werent doing so well And that got me thinking The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math sure theyre hard ratios decimals the area of a parallelogram But these concepts are not impossible and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough After several more years of teaching I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective from a psychological perspective In education the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ But what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily So I left the classroom and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings and in every study my question was who is successful here and why My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year and of those who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students We partnered with private companies asking which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs And whos going to earn the most money In all those very different contexts one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success And it wasnt social intelligence It wasnt good looks physical health and it wasnt IQ It was grit Grit is passion and perseverance for very longterm goals Grit is having stamina Grit is sticking with your future day in day out not just for the week not just for the month but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality Grit is living life like its a marathon not a sprint A few years ago I started studying grit in the Chicago public schools I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure things like family income standardized achievement test scores even how safe kids felt when they were at school So its not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters Its also in school especially for kids at risk for dropping out To me the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know how little science knows about building it Every day parents and teachers ask me How do I build grit in kids What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic How do I keep them motivated for the long run The honest answer is I dont know What I do know is that talent doesnt make you gritty Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments In fact in our data grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent So far the best idea Ive heard about building grit in kids is something called growth mindset This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change with your effort Dr Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge theyre much more likely to persevere when they fail because they dont believe that failure is a permanent condition So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit But we need more And thats where Im going to end my remarks because thats where we are Thats the work that stands before us We need to take our best ideas our strongest intuitions and we need to test them We need to measure whether weve been successful and we have to be willing to fail to be wrong to start over again with lessons learned In other words we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier Thank youTheres a man by the name of Captain William Swenson who recently was awarded the congressional Medal of Honor for his actions on September 8 2009 On that day a column of American and Afghan troops were making their way through a part of Afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials a group of Afghan government officials who would be meeting with some local village elders The column came under ambush and was surrounded on three sides and amongst many other things Captain Swenson was recognized for running into live fire to rescue the wounded and pull out the dead One of the people he rescued was a sergeant and he and a comrade were making their way to a medevac helicopter And what was remarkable about this day is by sheer coincidence one of the medevac medics happened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet and captured the whole scene on camera It shows Captain Swenson and his comrade bringing this wounded soldier who had received a gunshot to the neck They put him in the helicopter and then you see Captain Swenson bend over and give him a kiss before he turns around to rescue more I saw this and I thought to myself where do people like that come from What is that That is some deep deep emotion when you would want to do that Theres a love there and I wanted to know why is it that I dont have people that I work with like that You know in the military they give medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain In business we give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain We have it backwards Right So I asked myself where do people like this come from And my initial conclusion was that theyre just better people Thats why theyre attracted to the military These better people are attracted to this concept of service But thats completely wrong What I learned was that its the environment and if you get the environment right every single one of us has the capacity to do these remarkable things and more importantly others have that capacity too Ive had the great honor of getting to meet some of these who we would call heroes who have put themselves and put their lives at risk to save others and I asked them Why would you do it Why did you do it And they all say the same thing Because they would have done it for me Its this deep sense of trust and cooperation So trust and cooperation are really important here The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation is that they are feelings they are not instructions I cant simply say to you Trust me and you will I cant simply instruct two people to cooperate and they will Its not how it works Its a feeling So where does that feeling come from If you go back 50000 years to the Paleolithic era to the early days of Homo sapiens what we find is that the world was filled with danger all of these forces working very very hard to kill us Nothing personal Whether it was the weather lack of resources maybe a sabertoothed tiger all of these things working to reduce our lifespan And so we evolved into social animals where we lived together and worked together in what I call a circle of safety inside the tribe where we felt like we belonged And when we felt safe amongst our own the natural reaction was trust and cooperation There are inherent benefits to this It means I can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger If we dont trust each other if I dont trust you that means you wont watch for danger Bad system of survival The modern day is exactly the same thing The world is filled with danger things that are trying to frustrate our lives or reduce our success reduce our opportunity for success It could be the ups and downs in the economy the uncertainty of the stock market It could be a new technology that renders your business model obsolete overnight Or it could be your competition that is sometimes trying to kill you Its sometimes trying to put you out of business but at the very minimum is working hard to frustrate your growth and steal your business from you We have no control over these forces These are a constant and theyre not going away The only variable are the conditions inside the organization and thats where leadership matters because its the leader that sets the tone When a leader makes the choice to put the safety and lives of the people inside the organization first to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice the tangible results so that the people remain and feel safe and feel like they belong remarkable things happen I was flying on a trip and I was witness to an incident where a passenger attempted to board before their number was called and I watched the gate agent treat this man like he had broken the law like a criminal He was yelled at for attempting to board one group too soon So I said something I said Why do you have treat us like cattle Why cant you treat us like human beings And this is exactly what she said to me She said Sir if I dont follow the rules I could get in trouble or lose my job All she was telling me is that she doesnt feel safe All she was telling me is that she doesnt trust her leaders The reason we like flying Southwest Airlines is not because they necessarily hire better people Its because they dont fear their leaders You see if the conditions are wrong we are forced to expend our own time and energy to protect ourselves from each other and that inherently weakens the organization When we feel safe inside the organization we will naturally combine our talents and our strengths and work tirelessly to face the dangers outside and seize the opportunities The closest analogy I can give to what a great leader is is like being a parent If you think about what being a great parent is what do you want What makes a great parent We want to give our child opportunities education discipline them when necessary all so that they can grow up and achieve more than we could for ourselves Great leaders want exactly the same thing They want to provide their people opportunity education discipline when necessary build their selfconfidence give them the opportunity to try and fail all so that they could achieve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves Charlie Kim whos the CEO of a company called Next Jump in New York City a tech company he makes the point that if you had hard times in your family would you ever consider laying off one of your children We would never do it Then why do we consider laying off people inside our organization Charlie implemented a policy of lifetime employment If you get a job at Next Jump you cannot get fired for performance issues In fact if you have issues they will coach you and they will give you support just like we would with one of our children who happens to come home with a C from school Its the complete opposite This is the reason so many people have such a visceral hatred anger at some of these banking CEOs with their disproportionate salaries and bonus structures Its not the numbers Its that they have violated the very definition of leadership They have violated this deepseated social contract We know that they allowed their people to be sacrificed so they could protect their own interests or worse they sacrificed their people to protect their own interests This is what so offends us not the numbers Would anybody be offended if we gave a 150 million bonus to Gandhi How about a 250 million bonus to Mother Teresa Do we have an issue with that None at all None at all Great leaders would never sacrifice the people to save the numbers They would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the people Bob Chapman who runs a large manufacturing company in the Midwest called BarryWehmiller in 2008 was hit very hard by the recession and they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight Now in a large manufacturing company this is a big deal and they could no longer afford their labor pool They needed to save 10 million dollars so like so many companies today the board got together and discussed layoffs And Bob refused You see Bob doesnt believe in head counts Bob believes in heart counts and its much more difficult to simply reduce the heart count And so they came up with a furlough program Every employee from secretary to CEO was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation They could take it any time they wanted and they did not have to take it consecutively But it was how Bob announced the program that mattered so much He said its better that we should all suffer a little than any of us should have to suffer a lot and morale went up They saved 20 million dollars and most importantly as would be expected when the people feel safe and protected by the leadership in the organization the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate And quite spontaneously nobody expected people started trading with each other Those who could afford it more would trade with those who could afford it less People would take five weeks so that somebody else only had to take three Leadership is a choice It is not a rank I know many people at the seniormost levels of organizations who are absolutely not leaders They are authorities and we do what they say because they have authority over us but we would not follow them And I know many people who are at the bottoms of organizations who have no authority and they are absolutely leaders and this is because they have chosen to look after the person to the left of them and they have chosen to look after the person to the right of them This is what a leader is I heard a story of some Marines who were out in theater and as is the Marine custom the officer ate last and he let his men eat first and when they were done there was no food left for him And when they went back out in the field his men brought him some of their food so that he may eat because thats what happens We call them leaders because they go first We call them leaders because they take the risk before anybody else does We call them leaders because they will choose to sacrifice so that their people may be safe and protected and so their people may gain and when we do the natural response is that our people will sacrifice for us They will give us their blood and sweat and tears to see that their leaders vision comes to life and when we ask them Why would you do that Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears for that person they all say the same thing Because they would have done it for me And isnt that the organization we would all like to work in Thank you very much Thank youIve been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense  a sense that would give us seamless access and easy access to metainformation or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that were coming across And some of you may argue Well dont todays cell phones do that already But I would say no When you meet someone here at TED  and this is the top networking place of course of the year  you dont shake somebodys hand and then say Can you hold on for a moment while I take out my phone and Google you Or when you go to the supermarket and youre standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers you dont take out your cell phone and open a browser and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make So we dont really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take And so my research group at the Media Lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior And Im here to unveil our latest effort and most successful effort so far which is still very much a work in process Im actually wearing the device right now and weve sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf  and that by the way only cost 350 dollars at this point in time Im wearing a camera just a simple web cam a portable batterypowered projection system with a little mirror These components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket which acts as the communication and computation device And in the video here we see my student Pranav Mistry whos really the genius whos been implementing and designing this whole system And we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him The system tracks the four significant fingers In this case hes wearing simple marker caps that you may recognize But if you want a more stylish version you could also paint your nails in different colors And the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes any gestures that hes making so he can just go to for example a map of Long Beach zoom in and out etc The system also recognizes iconic gestures such as the take a picture gesture and then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you And when he then walks back to the Media Lab he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that hes taken sort through them and organize them and resize them etc again using all natural gestures So some of you most likely were here two years ago and saw the demo by Jeff Han or some of you may think Well doesnt this look like the Microsoft Surface Table And yes you also interact using natural gestures both hands etc But the difference here is that you can use any surface you can walk up to any surface including your hand if nothing else is available and interact with this projected data The device is completely portable and can be  So one important difference is that its totally mobile Another even more important difference is that in mass production this would not cost more tomorrow than todays cell phones and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging  could look a lot more stylish than this version that Im wearing around my neck But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in Minority Report the reason why were really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixthsense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you So we see Pranav here going into the supermarket and hes shopping for some paper towels And as he picks up a product the system can recognize the product that hes picking up using either image recognition or marker technology and give him the green light or an orange light He can ask for additional information So this particular choice here is a particularly good choice given his personal criteria Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice If he picks up a book in the bookstore he can get an Amazon rating  it gets projected right on the cover of the book This is Juans book our previous speaker which gets a great rating by the way at Amazon And so Pranav turns the page of the book and can then see additional information about the book  reader comments maybe sort of information by his favorite critic etc If he turns to a particular page he finds an annotation by maybe an expert or a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular page Reading the newspaper  it never has to be outdated You can get video annotations of the events that youre reading about You can get the latest sports scores etc This is a more controversial one As you interact with someone at TED maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pages In this case the student is interested in cameras etc On your way to the airport if you pick up your boarding pass it can tell you that your flight is delayed that the gate has changed etc And if you need to know what the current time is its as simple as drawing a watch  on your arm So thats where were at so far in developing this sixth sense that would give us seamless access to all this relevant information about the things that we may come across My student Pranav whos really like I said the genius behind this He does deserve a lot of applause because I dont think hes slept much in the last three months actually And his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either But its not perfect yet its very much a work in progress And who knows maybe in another 10 years well be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant Thank youAll right I want to see a show of hands how many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook because they said something offensive about politics or religion childcare food And how many of you know at least one person that you avoid because you just dont want to talk to them You know it used to be that in order to have a polite conversation we just had to follow the advice of Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady Stick to the weather and your health But these days with climate change and antivaxxing those subjects  footnote footnote are not safe either So this world that we live in this world in which every conversation has the potential to devolve into an argument where our politicians cant speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it its not normal Pew Research did a study of 10000 American adults and they found that at this moment we are more polarized we are more divided than we ever have been in history Were less likely to compromise which means were not listening to each other And we make decisions about where to live who to marry and even who our friends are going to be based on what we already believe Again that means were not listening to each other A conversation requires a balance between talking and listening and somewhere along the way we lost that balance footnote footnote Now part of that is due to technology The smartphones that you all either have in your hands or close enough that you could grab them really quickly According to Pew Research about a third of American teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day And many of them almost most of them are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to face Theres this great piece in The Atlantic It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell And he gave his kids a communication project He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes And he said this “I came to realize” I came to realize that conversational competence might be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach Kids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens but rarely do they have an opportunity to hone their interpersonal communications skills It might sound like a funny question but we have to ask ourselves Is there any 21stcentury skill more important than being able to sustain coherent confident conversation Now I make my living talking to people Nobel Prize winners truck drivers billionaires kindergarten teachers heads of state plumbers I talk to people that I like I talk to people that I don’t like I talk to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level But I still have a great conversation with them So Id like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen Many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this things like look the person in the eye think of interesting topics to discuss in advance look nod and smile to show that youre paying attention repeat back what you just heard or summarize it So I want you to forget all of that It is crap There is no reason to learn how to show youre paying attention if you are in fact paying attention Now I actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer that I do in regular life So Im going to teach you how to interview people and thats actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time without getting bored and please God without offending anybody Weve all had really great conversations Weve had them before We know what its like The kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired or where you feel like youve made a real connection or youve been perfectly understood There is no reason why most of your interactions cant be like that So I have 10 basic rules Im going to walk you through all of them but honestly if you just choose one of them and master it youll already enjoy better conversations Number one Dont multitask And I dont mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand I mean be present Be in that moment Dont think about your argument you had with your boss Dont think about what youre going to have for dinner If you want to get out of the conversation get out of the conversation but dont be half in it and half out of it Number two Dont pontificate If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth write a blog Now theres a really good reason why I dont allow pundits on my show Because theyre really boring If theyre conservative theyre going to hate Obama and food stamps and abortion If theyre liberal theyre going to hate big banks and oil corporations and Dick Cheney Totally predictable And you dont want to be like that You need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn The famed therapist M Scott Peck said that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself And sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion He said that sensing this acceptance the speaker will become less and less vulnerable and more and more likely to open up the inner recesses of his or her mind to the listener Again assume that you have something to learn Bill Nye Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you dont I put it this way Everybody is an expert in something Number three Use openended questions In this case take a cue from journalists Start your questions with who what when where why or how If you put in a complicated question youre going to get a simple answer out If I ask you Were you terrified youre going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence which is terrified and the answer is Yes I was or No I wasnt Were you angry Yes I was very angry Let them describe it Theyre the ones that know Try asking them things like What was that like How did that feel Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it and youre going to get a much more interesting response Number four Go with the flow That means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind Weve heard interviews often in which a guest is talking for several minutes and then the host comes back in and asks a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere or its already been answered That means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever question and he was just bound and determined to say that And we do the exact same thing Were sitting there having a conversation with someone and then we remember that time that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop And we stop listening Stories and ideas are going to come to you You need to let them come and let them go Number five If you dont know say that you dont know Now people on the radio especially on NPR are much more aware that theyre going on the record and so theyre more careful about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure Do that Err on the side of caution Talk should not be cheap footnote footnote Number six Dont equate your experience with theirs If theyre talking about having lost a family member dont start talking about the time you lost a family member If theyre talking about the trouble theyre having at work dont tell them about how much you hate your job Its not the same It is never the same All experiences are individual And more importantly it is not about you You dont need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are or how much youve suffered Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once what his IQ was and he said I have no idea People who brag about their IQs are losers Conversations are not a promotional opportunity Number seven Try not to repeat yourself Its condescending and its really boring and we tend to do it a lot Especially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids we have a point to make so we just keep rephrasing it over and over Dont do that Number eight Stay out of the weeds Frankly people dont care about the years the names the dates all those details that youre struggling to come up with in your mind They dont care What they care about is you They care about what youre like what you have in common So forget the details Leave them out footnote footnote Number nine This is not the last one but it is the most important one Listen I cannot tell you how many really important people have said that listening is perhaps the most the number one most important skill that you could develop Buddha said and Im paraphrasing If your mouth is open youre not learning And Calvin Coolidge said No man ever listened his way out of a job footnote footnote Why do we not listen to each other Number one wed rather talk When Im talking Im in control I dont have to hear anything Im not interested in Im the center of attention I can bolster my own identity But theres another reason We get distracted The average person talks at about 225 word per minute but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute So our minds are filling in those other 275 words And look I know it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone but if you cant do that youre not in a conversation Youre just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place You have to listen to one another Stephen Covey said it very beautifully He said Most of us dont listen with the intent to understand We listen with the intent to reply One more rule number 10 and it’s this one Be brief Be interested in other people footnote footnote You know I grew up with a very famous grandfather and there was kind of a ritual in my home People would come over to talk to my grandparents and after they would leave my mother would come over to us and she’d say “Do you know who that was She was the runnerup to Miss America He was the mayor of Sacramento She won a Pulitzer Prize Hes a Russian ballet dancer And I kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden amazing thing about them And honestly I think its what makes me a better host I keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can I keep my mind open And I’m always prepared to be amazed and Im never disappointed You do the same thing Go out talk to people listen to people and most importantly be prepared to be amazed ThanksHello Doha Hello Salaam alaikum I love coming to Doha Its such an international place It feels like the United Nations here You land at the airport and youre welcomed by an Indian lady who takes you to Al Maha Services where you meet a Filipino lady who hands you off to a South African lady who then takes you to a Korean who takes you to a Pakistani guy with the luggage who takes you to the car with a Sri Lankan You go to the hotel and you check in Theres a Lebanese Yeah And then a Swedish guy showed me my room I said Where are the Qataris They said No no its too hot They come out later Theyre smart They know And of course its growing so fast sometimes theres growing pains You know like sometimes you run into people that you think know the city well but they dont know it that well My Indian cab driver showed up at the W and I asked him to take me to the Sheraton and he said No problem sir And then we sat there for two minutes I said Whats wrong He said One problem sir I said What He goes Where is it I go Youre the driver you should know He goes No I just arrived sir I go You just arrived at the W No I just arrived in Doha sir I was on my way home from the airport I got a job Im working already He goes Sir why dont you drive I dont know where were going Neither do I It will be an adventure sir The Middle East has been an adventure the past couple of years It is going crazy with the Arab Spring and revolution and all this Are there any Lebanese here tonight by applause Lebanese yeah The Middle East is going crazy You know the Middle East is going crazy when Lebanon is the most peaceful place in the region Who would have thought Oh my gosh No theres serious issues in the region Some people dont want to talk about them Im here to talk about them tonight Ladies and gentlemen of the Middle East heres a serious issue When we see each other when we say hello how many kisses are we going to do Every country is different and its confusing okay In Lebanon they do three In Egypt they do two I was in Lebanon I got used to three I went to Egypt I went to say hello to this one Egyptian guy I went one two I went for three  He wasnt into it I told him I said No no I was just in Lebanon He goes I dont care where you were You just stay where you are please I went to Saudi Arabia In Saudi Arabia they go one two and then they stay on the same side three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  Next time you see a Saudi look closely Theyre just a little bit tilted Abdul are you okay I was saying hello for half an hour Ill be all right Qataris you guys do the nose to nose Why is that Are you too tired to go all the way around Habibi its so hot Just come here for a second Say hello Hello Habibi Just dont move Just stay there please I need to rest Iranians sometimes we do two sometimes we do three A friend of mine explained to me before the 79 revolution it was two After the revolution three So with Iranians you can tell whose side the person is on based on the number of kisses they give you Yeah if you go one two three  I cant believe you support this regime With your three kisses But no guys really it is exciting to be here and like I said you guys are doing a lot culturally you know and its amazing and it helps change the image of the Middle East in the West A lot of Americans dont know a lot about us about the Middle East Im Iranian and American Im there I know Ive traveled here Theres so much we laugh right People dont know we laugh When I did the Axis of Evil comedy tour it came out on Comedy Central I went online to see what people were saying I ended up on a conservative website One guy wrote another guy He said I never knew these people laughed Think about it You never see us laughing in American film or television right Maybe like an evil laugh Wuhahaha I will kill you in the name of Allah wuhahahahaha But never like Ha ha ha ha la We like to laugh We like to celebrate life And I wish more Americans would travel here I always encourage my friends Travel see the Middle East theres so much to see so many good people And its vice versa and it helps stop problems of misunderstanding and stereotypes from happening For example I dont know if you heard about this a little while ago in the US there was a Muslim family walking down the aisle of an airplane talking about the safest place to sit on the plane Some passengers overheard them somehow misconstrued that as terrorist talk got them kicked off the plane It was a family a mother father child talking about the seating As a Middle Eastern male I know theres certain things Im not supposed to say on an airplane in the US right Im not supposed to be walking down the aisle and be like Hi Jack Thats not cool Even if Im there with my friend named Jack I say Greetings Jack Salutations Jack Never Hi Jack But now apparently we cant even talk about the safest place to sit on an airplane So my advice to all my Middle Eastern friends and Muslim friends and anyone who looks Middle Eastern or Muslim so to you know Indians and Latinos everyone if youre brown  Heres my advice to my brown friends The next time youre on an airplane in the US just speak your mother tongue That way no one knows what youre saying Life goes on Granted some mother tongues might sound a little threatening to the average American If youre walking down the aisle speaking Arabic you might freak them out  They might say Whats he talking about The key to my Arab brothers and sisters is to throw in random good words to put people at ease as youre walking down the aisle Just as youre walking down  Strawberry Rainbow Tutti Frutti I think hes going to hijack the plane with some ice cream Thank you very much Have a good night Thank you TEDIm really excited to share with you some findings that really surprise me about what makes companies succeed the most what factors actually matter the most for startup success I believe that the startup organization is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place If you take a group of people with the right equity incentives and organize them in a startup you can unlock human potential in a way never before possible You get them to achieve unbelievable things But if the startup organization is so great why do so many fail Thats what I wanted to find out I wanted to find out what actually matters most for startup success And I wanted to try to be systematic about it avoid some of my instincts and maybe misperceptions I have from so many companies Ive seen over the years I wanted to know this because Ive been starting businesses since I was 12 years old when I sold candy at the bus stop in junior high school to high school when I made solar energy devices to college when I made loudspeakers And when I graduated from college I started software companies And 20 years ago I started Idealab and in the last 20 years we started more than 100 companies many successes and many big failures We learned a lot from those failures So I tried to look across what factors accounted the most for company success and failure So I looked at these five First the idea I used to think that the idea was everything I named my company Idealab for how much I worship the aha moment when you first come up with the idea But then over time I came to think that maybe the team the execution adaptability that mattered even more than the idea I never thought Id be quoting boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage but he once said Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face And I think thats so true about business as well So much about a teams execution is its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the customer The customer is the true reality And thats why I came to think that the team maybe was the most important thing Then I started looking at the business model Does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues That started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe what mattered most for success Then I looked at the funding Sometimes companies received intense amounts of funding Maybe thats the most important thing And then of course the timing Is the idea way too early and the worlds not ready for it Is it early as in youre in advance and you have to educate the world Is it just right Or is it too late and theres already too many competitors So I tried to look very carefully at these five factors across many companies And I looked across all 100 Idealab companies and 100 nonIdealab companies to try and come up with something scientific about it So first on these Idealab companies the top five companies  Citysearch CarsDirect GoTo NetZero Ticketscom  those all became billiondollar successes And the five companies on the bottom  Zcom Insider Pages MyLife Desktop Factory Peoplelink  we all had high hopes for but didnt succeed So I tried to rank across all of those attributes how I felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions And then for nonIdealab companies I looked at wild successes like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and LinkedIn And some failures Webvan Kozmo Petscom Flooz and Friendster The bottom companies had intense funding they even had business models in some cases but they didnt succeed I tried to look at what factors actually accounted the most for success and failure across all of these companies and the results really surprised me The number one thing was timing Timing accounted for 42 percent of the difference between success and failure Team and execution came in second and the idea the differentiability of the idea the uniqueness of the idea that actually came in third Now this isnt absolutely definitive its not to say that the idea isnt important but it very much surprised me that the idea wasnt the most important thing Sometimes it mattered more when it was actually timed The last two business model and funding made sense to me actually I think business model makes sense to be that low because you can start out without a business model and add one later if your customers are demanding what youre creating And funding I think as well if youre underfunded at first but youre gaining traction especially in todays age its very very easy to get intense funding So now let me give you some specific examples about each of these So take a wild success like Airbnb that everybody knows about Well that company was famously passed on by many smart investors because people thought No ones going to rent out a space in their home to a stranger Of course people proved that wrong But one of the reasons it succeeded aside from a good business model a good idea great execution is the timing That company came out right during the height of the recession when people really needed extra money and that maybe helped people overcome their objection to renting out their own home to a stranger Same thing with Uber Uber came out incredible company incredible business model great execution too But the timing was so perfect for their need to get drivers into the system Drivers were looking for extra money it was very very important Some of our early successes Citysearch came out when people needed web pages GoTocom which we announced actually at TED in 1998 was when companies were looking for costeffective ways to get traffic We thought the idea was so great but actually the timing was probably maybe more important And then some of our failures We started a company called Zcom it was an online entertainment company We were so excited about it  we raised enough money we had a great business model we even signed incredibly great Hollywood talent to join the company But broadband penetration was too low in 19992000 It was too hard to watch video content online you had to put codecs in your browser and do all this stuff and the company eventually went out of business in 2003 Just two years later when the codec problem was solved by Adobe Flash and when broadband penetration crossed 50 percent in America YouTube was perfectly timed Great idea but unbelievable timing In fact YouTube didnt even have a business model when it first started It wasnt even certain that that would work out But that was beautifully beautifully timed So what I would say in summary is execution definitely matters a lot The idea matters a lot But timing might matter even more And the best way to really assess timing is to really look at whether consumers are really ready for what you have to offer them And to be really really honest about it not be in denial about any results that you see because if you have something you love you want to push it forward but you have to be very very honest about that factor on timing As I said earlier I think startups can change the world and make the world a better place I hope some of these insights can maybe help you have a slightly higher success ratio and thus make something great come to the world that wouldnt have happened otherwise Thank you very much youve been a great audienceWhen I was first learning to meditate the instruction was to simply pay attention to my breath and when my mind wandered to bring it back Sounded simple enough Yet Id sit on these silent retreats sweating through Tshirts in the middle of winter Id take naps every chance I got because it was really hard work Actually it was exhausting The instruction was simple enough but I was missing something really important So why is it so hard to pay attention Well studies show that even when were really trying to pay attention to something  like maybe this talk  at some point about half of us will drift off into a daydream or have this urge to check our Twitter feed So whats going on here It turns out that were fighting one of the most evolutionarilyconserved learning processes currently known in science one thats conserved back to the most basic nervous systems known to man This rewardbased learning process is called positive and negative reinforcement and basically goes like this We see some food that looks good our brain says Calories  Survival We eat the food we taste it  it tastes good And especially with sugar our bodies send a signal to our brain that says Remember what youre eating and where you found it We lay down this contextdependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time See food eat food feel good repeat Trigger behavior reward Simple right Well after a while our creative brains say You know what You can use this for more than just remembering where food is You know next time you feel bad why dont you try eating something good so youll feel better We thank our brains for the great idea try this and quickly learn that if we eat chocolate or ice cream when were mad or sad we feel better Same process just a different trigger Instead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach this emotional signal  feeling sad  triggers that urge to eat Maybe in our teenage years we were a nerd at school and we see those rebel kids outside smoking and we think Hey I want to be cool So we start smoking The Marlboro Man wasnt a dork and that was no accident See cool smoke to be cool feel good Repeat Trigger behavior reward And each time we do this we learn to repeat the process and it becomes a habit So later feeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something sweet Now with these same brain processes weve gone from learning to survive to literally killing ourselves with these habits Obesity and smoking are among the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the world So back to my breath What if instead of fighting our brains or trying to force ourselves to pay attention we instead tapped into this natural rewardbased learning process  but added a twist What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience Ill give you an example In my lab we studied whether mindfulness training could help people quit smoking Now just like trying to force myself to pay attention to my breath they could try to force themselves to quit smoking And the majority of them had tried this before and failed  on average six times Now with mindfulness training we dropped the bit about forcing and instead focused on being curious In fact we even told them to smoke What Yeah we said Go ahead and smoke just be really curious about what its like when you do And what did they notice Well heres an example from one of our smokers She said Mindful smoking smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals YUCK Now she knew cognitively that smoking was bad for her thats why she joined our program What she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes like shit Now she moved from knowledge to wisdom She moved from knowing in her head that smoking was bad for her to knowing it in her bones and the spell of smoking was broken She started to become disenchanted with her behavior Now the prefrontal cortex that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective it understands on an intellectual level that we shouldnt smoke And it tries its hardest to help us change our behavior to help us stop smoking to help us stop eating that second that third that fourth cookie We call this cognitive control Were using cognition to control our behavior Unfortunately this is also the first part of our brain that goes offline when we get stressed out which isnt that helpful Now we can all relate to this in our own experience Were much more likely to do things like yell at our spouse or kids when were stressed out or tired even though we know its not going to be helpful We just cant help ourselves When the prefrontal cortex goes offline we fall back into our old habits which is why this disenchantment is so important Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them at a deeper level  to know it in our bones so we dont have to force ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves from behavior Were just less interested in doing it in the first place And this is what mindfulness is all about Seeing really clearly what we get when we get caught up in our behaviors becoming disenchanted on a visceral level and from this disenchanted stance naturally letting go This isnt to say that poof magically we quit smoking But over time as we learn to see more and more clearly the results of our actions we let go of old habits and form new ones The paradox here is that mindfulness is just about being really interested in getting close and personal with whats actually happening in our bodies and minds from moment to moment This willingness to turn toward our experience rather than trying to make unpleasant cravings go away as quickly as possible And this willingness to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity which is naturally rewarding What does curiosity feel like It feels good And what happens when we get curious We start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations  oh theres tightness theres tension theres restlessness  and that these body sensations come and go These are bitesize pieces of experiences that we can manage from moment to moment rather than getting clobbered by this huge scary craving that we choke on In other words when we get curious we step out of our old fearbased reactive habit patterns and we step into being We become this inner scientist where were eagerly awaiting that next data point Now this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior But in one study we found that mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking So it actually works And when we studied the brains of experienced meditators we found that parts of a neural network of selfreferential processing called the default mode network were at play Now one current hypothesis is that a region of this network called the posterior cingulate cortex is activated not necessarily by craving itself but when we get caught up in it when we get sucked in and it takes us for a ride In contrast when we let go  step out of the process just by being curiously aware of whats happening  this same brain region quiets down Now were testing app and onlinebased mindfulness training programs that target these core mechanisms and ironically use the same technology thats driving us to distraction to help us step out of our unhealthy habit patterns of smoking of stress eating and other addictive behaviors Now remember that bit about contextdependent memory We can deliver these tools to peoples fingertips in the contexts that matter most So we can help them tap into their inherent capacity to be curiously aware right when that urge to smoke or stress eat or whatever arises So if you dont smoke or stress eat maybe the next time you feel this urge to check your email when youre bored or youre trying to distract yourself from work or maybe to compulsively respond to that text message when youre driving see if you can tap into this natural capacity just be curiously aware of whats happening in your body and mind in that moment It will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops  or step out of it Instead of see text message compulsively text back feel a little bit better  notice the urge get curious feel the joy of letting go and repeat Thank youI love learning foreign languages In fact I love it so much that I like to learn a new language every two years currently working on my eighth one When people find that out about me they always ask me How do you do that Whats your secret And to be honest for many years my answer would be I dont know I simply love learning languages But people were never happy with that answer They wanted to know why they are spending years trying to learn even one language never achieving fluency and here I come learning one language after another They wanted to know the secret of polyglots people who speak a lot of languages And that made me wonder too how do actually other polyglots do it What do we have in common And what is it that enables us to learn languages so much faster than other people I decided to meet other people like me and find that out The best place to meet a lot of polyglots is an event where hundreds of language lovers meet in one place to practice their languages There are several such polyglot events organized all around the world and so I decided to go there and ask polyglots about the methods that they use And so I met Benny from Ireland who told me that his method is to start speaking from day one He learns a few phrases from a travel phrasebook and goes to meet native speakers and starts having conversations with them right away He doesnt mind making even 200 mistakes a day because thats how he learns based on the feedback And the best thing is he doesnt even need to travel a lot today because you can easily have conversations with native speakers from the comfort of your living room using websites I also met Lucas from Brazil who had a really interesting method to learn Russian He simply added a hundred random Russian speakers on Skype as friends and then he opened a chat window with one of them and wrote Hi in Russian And the person replied Hi how are you Lucas copied this and put it into a text window with another person and the person replied Im fine thank you and how are you Lucas copied this back to the first person and in this way he had two strangers have a conversation with each other without knowing about it And soon he would start typing himself because he had so many of these conversations that he figured out how the Russian conversation usually starts What an ingenious method right And then I met polyglots who always start by imitating sounds of the language and others who always learn the 500 most frequent words of the language and yet others who always start by reading about the grammar If I asked a hundred different polyglots I heard a hundred different approaches to learning languages Everybody seems to have a unique way they learn a language and yet we all come to the same result of speaking several languages fluently And as I was listening to these polyglots telling me about their methods it suddenly dawned on me the one thing we all have in common is that we simply found ways to enjoy the languagelearning process All of these polyglots were talking about language learning as if it was great fun You should have seen their faces when they were showing me their colorful grammar charts and their carefully handmade flash cards and their statistics about learning vocabulary using apps or even how they love to cook based on recipes in a foreign language All of them use different methods but they always make sure its something that they personally enjoy I realized that this is actually how I learn languages myself When I was learning Spanish I was bored with the text in the textbook I mean who wants to read about Jose asking about the directions to the train station Right I wanted to read Harry Potter instead because that was my favorite book as a child and I have read it many times So I got the Spanish translation of Harry Potter and started reading and sure enough I didnt understand almost anything at the beginning but I kept on reading because I loved the book and by the end of the book I was able to follow it almost without any problems And the same thing happened when I was learning German I decided to watch Friends my favorite sitcom in German and again at the beginning it was all just gibberish I didnt know where one word finished and another one started but I kept on watching every day because its Friends I can watch it in any language I love it so much And after the second or third season seriously the dialogue started to make sense I only realized this after meeting other polyglots We are no geniuses and we have no shortcut to learning languages We simply found ways how to enjoy the process how to turn language learning from a boring school subject into a pleasant activity which you dont mind doing every day If you dont like writing words down on paper you can always type them in an app If you dont like listening to boring textbook material find interesting content on YouTube or in podcasts for any language If youre a more introverted person and you cant imagine speaking to native speakers right away you can apply the method of selftalk You can talk to yourself in the comfort of your room describing your plans for the weekend how your day has been or even take a random picture from your phone and describe the picture to your imaginary friend This is how polyglots learn languages and the best news is its available to anyone who is willing to take the learning into their own hands So meeting other polyglots helped me realize that it is really crucial to find enjoyment in the process of learning languages but also that joy in itself is not enough If you want to achieve fluency in a foreign language youll also need to apply three more principles First of all youll need effective methods If you try to memorize a list of words for a test tomorrow the words will be stored in your shortterm memory and youll forget them after a few days If you however want to keep words long term you need to revise them in the course of a few days repeatedly using the socalled space repetition You can use apps which are based on this system such as Anki or Memrise or you can write lists of word in a notebook using the Goldlist method which is also very popular with many polyglots If youre not sure which methods are effective and what is available out there just check out polyglots YouTube channels and websites and get inspiration from them If it works for them it will most probably work for you too The third principle to follow is to create a system in your learning Were all very busy and no one really has time to learn a language today But we can create that time if we just plan a bit ahead Can you wake up 15 minutes earlier than you normally do That would be the perfect time to revise some vocabulary Can you listen to a podcast on your way to work while driving Well that would be great to get some listening experience There are so many things we can do without even planning that extra time such as listening to podcasts on our way to work or doing our household chores The important thing is to create a plan in the learning I will practice speaking every Tuesday and Thursday with a friend for 20 minutes I will listen to a YouTube video while having breakfast If you create a system in your learning you dont need to find that extra time because it will become a part of your everyday life And finally if you want to learn a language fluently you need also a bit of patience Its not possible to learn a language within two months but its definitely possible to make a visible improvement in two months if you learn in small chunks every day in a way that you enjoy And there is nothing that motivates us more than our own success I vividly remember the moment when I understood the first joke in German when watching Friends I was so happy and motivated that I just kept on watching that day two more episodes and as I kept watching I had more and more of those moments of understanding these little victories and step by step I got to a level where I could use the language freely and fluently to express anything This is a wonderful feeling I cant get enough of that feeling and thats why I learn a language every two years So this is the whole polyglot secret Find effective methods which you can use systematically over the period of some time in a way which you enjoy and this is how polyglots learn languages within months not years Now some of you may be thinking Thats all very nice to enjoy language learning but isnt the real secret that you polyglots are just super talented and most of us arent Well theres one thing I havent told you about Benny and Lucas Benny had 11 years of Irish Gaelic and five years of German at school He couldnt speak them at all when graduating Up to the age of 21 he thought he didnt have the language gene and he could not speak another language Then he started to look for his way of learning languages which was speaking to native speakers and getting feedback from them and today Benny can easily have a conversation in 10 languages Lucas tried to learn English at school for 10 years He was one of the worst students in class His friends even made fun of him and gave him a Russian textbook as a joke because they thought he would never learn that language or any language And then Lucas started to experiment with methods looking for his own way to learn for example by having Skype chat conversations with strangers And after just 10 years Lucas is able to speak 11 languages fluently Does that sound like a miracle Well I see such miracles every single day As a language mentor I help people learn languages by themselves and I see this every day People struggle with language learning for five 10 even 20 years and then they suddenly take their learning into their own hands start using materials which they enjoy more effective methods or they start tracking their learning so that they can appreciate their own progress and thats when suddenly they magically find the language talent that they were missing all their lives So if youve also tried to learn a language and you gave up thinking its too difficult or you dont have the language talent give it another try Maybe youre also just one enjoyable method away from learning that language fluently Maybe youre just one method away from becoming a polyglot Thank youWhat started as a platform for hobbyists is poised to become a multibilliondollar industry Inspection environmental monitoring photography and film and journalism these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones and their enablers are the capabilities being developed at research facilities around the world footnote footnote For example before aerial package delivery entered our social consciousness an autonomous fleet of flying machines built a sixmetertall tower composed of 1500 bricks in front of a live audience at the FRAC Centre in France and several years ago they started to fly with ropes By tethering flying machines they can achieve high speeds and accelerations in very tight spaces They can also autonomously build tensile structures Skills learned include how to carry loads how to cope with disturbances and in general how to interact with the physical world Today we want to show you some new projects that weve been working on Their aim is to push the boundary of what can be achieved with autonomous flight Now for a system to function autonomously it must collectively know the location of its mobile objects in space Back at our lab at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to locate objects which then allows us to focus our efforts on the rapid development of highly dynamic tasks For the demos you will see today however we will use new localization technology developed by Verity Studios a spinoff from our lab There are no external cameras Each flying machine uses onboard sensors to determine its location in space and onboard computation to determine what its actions should be The only external commands are highlevel ones such as take off and land This is a socalled tailsitter Its an aircraft that tries to have its cake and eat it Like other fixedwing aircraft it is efficient in forward flight much more so than helicopters and variations thereof Unlike most other fixedwing aircraft however it is capable of hovering which has huge advantages for takeoff landing and general versatility There is no free lunch unfortunately One of the limitations with tailsitters is that theyre susceptible to disturbances such as wind gusts Were developing new control architectures and algorithms that address this limitation The idea is for the aircraft to recover no matter what state it finds itself in and through practice improve its performance over time OK footnote footnote When doing research we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that try to get at the heart of a matter For example one such question would be what is the minimum number of moving parts needed for controlled flight Now there are practical reasons why you may want to know the answer to such a question Helicopters for example are affectionately known as machines with a thousand moving parts all conspiring to do you bodily harm It turns out that decades ago skilled pilots were able to fly remotecontrolled aircraft that had only two moving parts a propeller and a tail rudder We recently discovered that it could be done with just one This is the monospinner the worlds mechanically simplest controllable flying machine invented just a few months ago It has only one moving part a propeller It has no flaps no hinges no ailerons no other actuators no other control surfaces just a simple propeller Even though its mechanically simple theres a lot going on in its little electronic brain to allow it to fly in a stable fashion and to move anywhere it wants in space Even so it doesnt yet have the sophisticated algorithms of the tailsitter which means that in order to get it to fly I have to throw it just right And because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low given everybody watching me what were going to do instead is show you a video that we shot last night footnote footnote If the monospinner is an exercise in frugality this machine here the omnicopter with its eight propellers is an exercise in excess What can you do with all this surplus The thing to notice is that it is highly symmetric As a result it is ambivalent to orientation This gives it an extraordinary capability It can move anywhere it wants in space irrespective of where it is facing and even of how it is rotating It has its own complexities mainly having to do with the interacting flows from its eight propellers Some of this can be modeled while the rest can be learned on the fly Lets take a look footnote footnote If flying machines are going to enter part of our daily lives they will need to become extremely safe and reliable This machine over here is actually two separate twopropeller flying machines This one wants to spin clockwise This other one wants to spin counterclockwise When you put them together they behave like one highperformance quadrocopter If anything goes wrong however  a motor fails a propeller fails electronics even a battery pack  the machine can still fly albeit in a degraded fashion Were going to demonstrate this to you now by disabling one of its halves footnote footnote This last demonstration is an exploration of synthetic swarms The large number of autonomous coordinated entities offers a new palette for aesthetic expression Weve taken commercially available micro quadcopters each weighing less than a slice of bread by the way and outfitted them with our localization technology and custom algorithms Because each unit knows where it is in space and is selfcontrolled there is really no limit to their number Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to dream up new revolutionary roles for flying machines That ultrasafe one over there for example has aspirations to become a flying lampshade on Broadway The reality is that it is difficult to predict the impact of nascent technology And for folks like us the real reward is the journey and the act of creation Its a continual reminder of how wonderful and magical the universe we live in is that it allows creative clever creatures to sculpt it in such spectacular ways The fact that this technology has such huge commercial and economic potential is just icing on the cake Thank youThe power of yet I heard about a high school in Chicago where students had to pass a certain number of courses to graduate and if they didnt pass a course they got the grade Not Yet And I thought that was fantastic because if you get a failing grade you think Im nothing Im nowhere But if you get the grade Not Yet you understand that youre on a learning curve It gives you a path into the future Not Yet also gave me insight into a critical event early in my career a real turning point I wanted to see how children coped with challenge and difficulty so I gave 10yearolds problems that were slightly too hard for them Some of them reacted in a shockingly positive way They said things like I love a challenge or You know I was hoping this would be informative They understood that their abilities could be developed They had what I call a growth mindset But other students felt it was tragic catastrophic From their more fixed mindset perspective their intelligence had been up for judgment and they failed Instead of luxuriating in the power of yet they were gripped in the tyranny of now So what do they do next Ill tell you what they do next In one study they told us they would probably cheat the next time instead of studying more if they failed a test In another study after a failure they looked for someone who did worse than they did so they could feel really good about themselves And in study after study they have run from difficulty Scientists measured the electrical activity from the brain as students confronted an error On the left you see the fixedmindset students Theres hardly any activity They run from the error They dont engage with it But on the right you have the students with the growth mindset the idea that abilities can be developed They engage deeply Their brain is on fire with yet They engage deeply They process the error They learn from it and they correct it How are we raising our children Are we raising them for now instead of yet Are we raising kids who are obsessed with getting As Are we raising kids who dont know how to dream big dreams Their biggest goal is getting the next A or the next test score And are they carrying this need for constant validation with them into their future lives Maybe because employers are coming to me and saying We have already raised a generation of young workers who cant get through the day without an award So what can we do How can we build that bridge to yet Here are some things we can do First of all we can praise wisely not praising intelligence or talent That has failed Dont do that anymore But praising the process that kids engage in their effort their strategies their focus their perseverance their improvement This process praise creates kids who are hardy and resilient There are other ways to reward yet We recently teamed up with game scientists from the University of Washington to create a new online math game that rewarded yet In this game students were rewarded for effort strategy and progress The usual math game rewards you for getting answers right right now but this game rewarded process And we got more effort more strategies more engagement over longer periods of time and more perseverance when they hit really really hard problems Just the words yet or not yet were finding give kids greater confidence give them a path into the future that creates greater persistence And we can actually change students mindsets In one study we taught them that every time they push out of their comfort zone to learn something new and difficult the neurons in their brain can form new stronger connections and over time they can get smarter Look what happened In this study students who were not taught this growth mindset continued to show declining grades over this difficult school transition but those who were taught this lesson showed a sharp rebound in their grades We have shown this now this kind of improvement with thousands and thousands of kids especially struggling students So lets talk about equality In our country there are groups of students who chronically underperform for example children in inner cities or children on Native American reservations And theyve done so poorly for so long that many people think its inevitable But when educators create growth mindset classrooms steeped in yet equality happens And here are just a few examples In one year a kindergarten class in Harlem New York scored in the 95th percentile on the national achievement test Many of those kids could not hold a pencil when they arrived at school In one year fourthgrade students in the South Bronx way behind became the number one fourthgrade class in the state of New York on the state math test In a year to a year and a half Native American students in a school on a reservation went from the bottom of their district to the top and that district included affluent sections of Seattle So the Native kids outdid the Microsoft kids This happened because the meaning of effort and difficulty were transformed Before effort and difficulty made them feel dumb made them feel like giving up but now effort and difficulty thats when their neurons are making new connections stronger connections Thats when theyre getting smarter I received a letter recently from a 13yearold boy He said Dear Professor Dweck I appreciate that your writing is based on solid scientific research and thats why I decided to put it into practice I put more effort into my schoolwork into my relationship with my family and into my relationship with kids at school and I experienced great improvement in all of those areas I now realize Ive wasted most of my life Lets not waste any more lives because once we know that abilities are capable of such growth it becomes a basic human right for children all children to live in places that create that growth to live in places filled with yetI have spent my entire life either at the schoolhouse on the way to the schoolhouse or talking about what happens in the schoolhouse Both my parents were educators my maternal grandparents were educators and for the past 40 years Ive done the same thing And so needless to say over those years Ive had a chance to look at education reform from a lot of perspectives Some of those reforms have been good Some of them have been not so good And we know why kids drop out We know why kids dont learn Its either poverty low attendance negative peer influences We know why But one of the things that we never discuss or we rarely discuss is the value and importance of human connection Relationships James Comer says that no significant learning can occur without a significant relationship George Washington Carver says all learning is understanding relationships Everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult For years I have watched people teach I have looked at the best and Ive looked at some of the worst A colleague said to me one time They dont pay me to like the kids They pay me to teach a lesson The kids should learn it I should teach it they should learn it Case closed Well I said to her You know kids dont learn from people they dont like She said Thats just a bunch of hooey And I said to her Well your year is going to be long and arduous dear Needless to say it was Some people think that you can either have it in you to build a relationship or you dont I think Stephen Covey had the right idea He said you ought to just throw in a few simple things like seeking first to understand as opposed to being understood Simple things like apologizing You ever thought about that Tell a kid youre sorry theyre in shock I taught a lesson once on ratios Im not real good with math but I was working on it And I got back and looked at that teacher edition Id taught the whole lesson wrong So I came back to class the next day and I said Look guys I need to apologize I taught the whole lesson wrong Im so sorry They said Thats okay Ms Pierson You were so excited we just let you go I have had classes that were so low so academically deficient that I cried I wondered How am I going to take this group in nine months from where they are to where they need to be And it was difficult it was awfully hard How do I raise the selfesteem of a child and his academic achievement at the same time One year I came up with a bright idea I told all my students You were chosen to be in my class because I am the best teacher and you are the best students they put us all together so we could show everybody else how to do it One of the students said Really I said Really We have to show the other classes how to do it so when we walk down the hall people will notice us so you cant make noise You just have to strut And I gave them a saying to say I am somebody I was somebody when I came Ill be a better somebody when I leave I am powerful and I am strong I deserve the education that I get here I have things to do people to impress and places to go And they said Yeah You say it long enough it starts to be a part of you I gave a quiz 20 questions A student missed 18 I put a 2 on his paper and a big smiley face He said Ms Pierson is this an F I said Yes He said Then whyd you put a smiley face I said Because youre on a roll You got two right You didnt miss them all I said And when we review this wont you do better He said Yes maam I can do better You see 18 sucks all the life out of you 2 said I aint all bad For years I watched my mother take the time at recess to review go on home visits in the afternoon buy combs and brushes and peanut butter and crackers to put in her desk drawer for kids that needed to eat and a washcloth and some soap for the kids who didnt smell so good See its hard to teach kids who stink And kids can be cruel And so she kept those things in her desk and years later after she retired I watched some of those same kids come through and say to her You know Ms Walker you made a difference in my life You made it work for me You made me feel like I was somebody when I knew at the bottom I wasnt And I want you to just see what Ive become And when my mama died two years ago at 92 there were so many former students at her funeral it brought tears to my eyes not because she was gone but because she left a legacy of relationships that could never disappear Can we stand to have more relationships Absolutely Will you like all your children Of course not And you know your toughest kids are never absent Never You wont like them all and the tough ones show up for a reason Its the connection Its the relationships So teachers become great actors and great actresses and we come to work when we dont feel like it and were listening to policy that doesnt make sense and we teach anyway We teach anyway because thats what we do Teaching and learning should bring joy How powerful would our world be if we had kids who were not afraid to take risks who were not afraid to think and who had a champion Every child deserves a champion an adult who will never give up on them who understands the power of connection and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be Is this job tough You betcha Oh God you betcha But it is not impossible We can do this Were educators Were born to make a difference Thank you so muchWhen people find out I write about time management they assume two things One is that Im always on time and Im not I have four small children and I would like to blame them for my occasional tardiness but sometimes its just not their fault I was once late to my own speech on time management We all had to just take a moment together and savor that irony The second thing they assume is that I have lots of tips and tricks for saving bits of time here and there Sometimes Ill hear from magazines that are doing a story along these lines generally on how to help their readers find an extra hour in the day And the idea is that well shave bits of time off everyday activities add it up and well have time for the good stuff I question the entire premise of this piece but Im always interested in hearing what theyve come up with before they call me Some of my favorites doing errands where you only have to make righthand turns  Being extremely judicious in microwave usage it says three to threeandahalf minutes on the package were totally getting in on the bottom side of that And my personal favorite which makes sense on some level is to DVR your favorite shows so you can fastforward through the commercials That way you save eight minutes every half hour so in the course of two hours of watching TV you find 32 minutes to exercise Which is true You know another way to find 32 minutes to exercise Dont watch two hours of TV a day right Anyway the idea is well save bits of time here and there add it up we will finally get to everything we want to do But after studying how successful people spend their time and looking at their schedules hour by hour I think this idea has it completely backward We dont build the lives we want by saving time We build the lives we want and then time saves itself footnote footnote Heres what I mean I recently did a time diary project looking at 1001 days in the lives of extremely busy women They had demanding jobs sometimes their own businesses kids to care for maybe parents to care for community commitments  busy busy people I had them keep track of their time for a week so I could add up how much they worked and slept and I interviewed them about their strategies for my book One of the women whose time log I studied goes out on a Wednesday night for something She comes home to find that her water heater has broken and there is now water all over her basement If youve ever had anything like this happen to you you know it is a hugely damaging frightening sopping mess So shes dealing with the immediate aftermath that night next day shes got plumbers coming in day after that professional cleaning crew dealing with the ruined carpet All this is being recorded on her time log Winds up taking seven hours of her week Seven hours Thats like finding an extra hour in the day But Im sure if you had asked her at the start of the week Could you find seven hours to train for a triathlon Could you find seven hours to mentor seven worthy people Im sure she wouldve said what most of us wouldve said which is No  cant you see how busy I am Yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement she found seven hours And what this shows us is that time is highly elastic We cannot make more time but time will stretch to accommodate what we choose to put into it And so the key to time management is treating our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater To get at this I like to use language from one of the busiest people I ever interviewed By busy I mean she was running a small business with 12 people on the payroll she had six children in her spare time I was getting in touch with her to set up an interview on how she had it all  that phrase I remember it was a Thursday morning and she was not available to speak with me Of course right But the reason she was unavailable to speak with me is that she was out for a hike because it was a beautiful spring morning and she wanted to go for a hike So of course this makes me even more intrigued and when I finally do catch up with her she explains it like this She says Listen Laura everything I do every minute I spend is my choice And rather than say I dont have time to do x y or z shed say I dont do x y or z because its not a priority I dont have time often means Its not a priority If you think about it thats really more accurate language I could tell you I dont have time to dust my blinds but thats not true If you offered to pay me 100000 to dust my blinds I would get to it pretty quickly Since that is not going to happen I can acknowledge this is not a matter of lacking time its that I dont want to do it Using this language reminds us that time is a choice And granted there may be horrible consequences for making different choices I will give you that But we are smart people and certainly over the long run we have the power to fill our lives with the things that deserve to be there So how do we do that How do we treat our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater Well first we need to figure out what they are I want to give you two strategies for thinking about this The first on the professional side Im sure many people coming up to the end of the year are giving or getting annual performance reviews You look back over your successes over the year your opportunities for growth And this serves its purpose but I find its more effective to do this looking forward So I want you to pretend its the end of next year Youre giving yourself a performance review and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you professionally What three to five things did you do that made it so amazing So you can write next years performance review now And you can do this for your personal life too Im sure many of you like me come December get cards that contain these folded up sheets of colored paper on which is written what is known as the family holiday letter Bit of a wretched genre of literature really going on about how amazing everyone in the household is or even more scintillating how busy everyone in the household is But these letters serve a purpose which is that they tell your friends and family what you did in your personal life that mattered to you over the year So this years kind of done but I want you to pretend its the end of next year and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you and the people you care about What three to five things did you do that made it so amazing So you can write next years family holiday letter now Dont send it Please dont send it But you can write it And now between the performance review and the family holiday letter we have a list of six to ten goals we can work on in the next year And now we need to break these down into doable steps So maybe you want to write a family history First you can read some other family histories get a sense for the style Then maybe think about the questions you want to ask your relatives set up appointments to interview them Or maybe you want to run a 5K So you need to find a race and sign up figure out a training plan and dig those shoes out of the back of the closet And then  this is key  we treat our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater by putting them into our schedules first We do this by thinking through our weeks before we are in them I find a really good time to do this is Friday afternoons Friday afternoon is what an economist might call a low opportunity cost time Most of us are not sitting there on Friday afternoons saying I am excited to make progress toward my personal and professional priorities right now But we are willing to think about what those should be So take a little bit of time Friday afternoon make yourself a threecategory priority list career relationships self Making a threecategory list reminds us that there should be something in all three categories Career we think about relationships self  not so much But anyway just a short list two to three items in each Then look out over the whole of the next week and see where you can plan them in Where you plan them in is up to you I know this is going to be more complicated for some people than others I mean some peoples lives are just harder than others It is not going to be easy to find time to take that poetry class if you are caring for multiple children on your own I get that And I dont want to minimize anyones struggle But I do think that the numbers I am about to tell you are empowering There are 168 hours in a week Twentyfour times seven is 168 hours That is a lot of time If you are working a fulltime job so 40 hours a week sleeping eight hours a night so 56 hours a week  that leaves 72 hours for other things That is a lot of time You say youre working 50 hours a week maybe a main job and a side hustle Well that leaves 62 hours for other things You say youre working 60 hours Well that leaves 52 hours for other things You say youre working more than 60 hours Well are you sure There was once a study comparing peoples estimated work weeks with time diaries They found that people claiming 75plushour work weeks were off by about 25 hours footnote footnote You can guess in which direction right Anyway in 168 hours a week I think we can find time for what matters to you If you want to spend more time with your kids you want to study more for a test youre taking you want to exercise for three hours and volunteer for two you can And thats even if youre working way more than fulltime hours So we have plenty of time which is great because guess what We dont even need that much time to do amazing things But when most of us have bits of time what do we do Pull out the phone right Start deleting emails Otherwise were puttering around the house or watching TV But small moments can have great power You can use your bits of time for bits of joy Maybe its choosing to read something wonderful on the bus on the way to work I know when I had a job that required two bus rides and a subway ride every morning I used to go to the library on weekends to get stuff to read It made the whole experience almost almost enjoyable Breaks at work can be used for meditating or praying If family dinner is out because of your crazy work schedule maybe family breakfast could be a good substitute Its about looking at the whole of ones time and seeing where the good stuff can go I truly believe this There is time Even if we are busy we have time for what matters And when we focus on what matters we can build the lives we want in the time weve got Thank youWhat is the intersection between technology art and science Curiosity and wonder because it drives us to explore because were surrounded by things we cant see And I love to use film to take us on a journey through portals of time and space to make the invisible visible because what that does it expands our horizons it transforms our perception it opens our minds and it touches our heart So here are some scenes from my 3D IMAX film Mysteries of the Unseen World There is movement which is too slow for our eyes to detect and time lapse makes us discover and broaden our perspective of life We can see how organisms emerge and grow how a vine survives by creeping from the forest floor to look at the sunlight And at the grand scale time lapse allows us to see our planet in motion We can view not only the vast sweep of nature but the restless movement of humanity Each streaking dot represents a passenger plane and by turning air traffic data into timelapse imagery we can see something thats above us constantly but invisible the vast network of air travel over the United States We can do the same thing with ships at sea We can turn data into a timelapse view of a global economy in motion And decades of data give us the view of our entire planet as a single organism sustained by currents circulating throughout the oceans and by clouds swirling through the atmosphere pulsing with lightning crowned by the aurora Borealis It may be the ultimate timelapse image the anatomy of Earth brought to life At the other extreme there are things that move too fast for our eyes but we have technology that can look into that world as well With highspeed cameras we can do the opposite of time lapse We can shoot images that are thousands of times faster than our vision And we can see how natures ingenious devices work and perhaps we can even imitate them When a dragonfly flutters by you may not realize but its the greatest flier in nature It can hover fly backwards even upside down And by tracking markers on an insects wings we can visualize the air flow that they produce Nobody knew the secret but high speed shows that a dragonfly can move all four wings in different directions at the same time And what we learn can lead us to new kinds of robotic flyers that can expand our vision of important and remote places Were giants and were unaware of things that are too small for us to see The electron microscope fires electrons which creates images which can magnify things by as much as a million times This is the egg of a butterfly And there are unseen creatures living all over your body including mites that spend their entire lives dwelling on your eyelashes crawling over your skin at night Can you guess what this is Shark skin A caterpillars mouth The eye of a fruit fly An eggshell A flea A snails tongue We think we know most of the animal kingdom but there may be millions of tiny species waiting to be discovered A spider also has great secrets because spiders silk thread is pound for pound stronger than steel but completely elastic This journey will take us all the way down to the nano world The silk is 100 times thinner than human hair On there is bacteria and near that bacteria 10 times smaller a virus Inside of that 10 times smaller three strands of DNA And nearing the limit of our most powerful microscopes single carbon atoms With the tip of a powerful microscope we can actually move atoms and begin to create amazing nano devices Some could one day patrol our body for all kinds of diseases and clean out clogged arteries along the way Tiny chemical machines of the future can one day perhaps repair DNA We are on the threshold of extraordinary advances born of our drive to unveil the mysteries of life So under an endless rain of cosmic dust the air is full of pollen microdiamonds and jewels from other planets and supernova explosions People go about their lives surrounded by the unseeable Knowing that theres so much around us we cant see forever changes our understanding of the world and by looking at unseen worlds we recognize that we exist in the living universe and this new perspective creates wonder and inspires us to become explorers in our own backyards Who knows what awaits to be seen and what new wonders will transform our lives Well just have to see Thank youWe live in an incredibly busy world The pace of life is often frantic our minds are always busy and were always doing something So with that in mind Id like you just to take a moment to think when did you last take any time to do nothing Just 10 minutes undisturbed And when I say nothing I do mean nothing So thats no emailing texting no Internet no TV no chatting no eating no reading Not even sitting there reminiscing about the past or planning for the future Simply doing nothing I see a lot of very blank faces You probably have to go a long way back And this is an extraordinary thing right Were talking about our mind The mind our most valuable and precious resource through which we experience every single moment of our life The mind that we rely upon to be happy content emotionally stable as individuals and at the same time to be kind and thoughtful and considerate in our relationships with others This is the same mind that we depend upon to be focused creative spontaneous and to perform at our very best in everything that we do And yet we dont take any time out to look after it In fact we spend more time looking after our cars our clothes and our hair than we  okay maybe not our hair but you see where Im going The result of course is that we get stressed You know the mind whizzes away like a washing machine going round and round lots of difficult confusing emotions and we dont really know how to deal with that And the sad fact is that we are so distracted that were no longer present in the world in which we live We miss out on the things that are most important to us and the crazy thing is that everybody just assumes thats the way life is so weve just kind of got to get on with it Thats really not how it has to be So I was about 11 when I went along to my first meditation class And trust me it had all the stereotypes that you can imagine the sitting crosslegged on the floor the incense the herbal tea the vegetarians the whole deal but my mom was going and I was intrigued so I went along with her Id also seen a few kung fu movies and secretly I kind of thought I might be able to learn how to fly but I was very young at the time Now as I was there I guess like a lot of people I assumed that it was just an aspirin for the mind You get stressed you do some meditation I hadnt really thought that it could be sort of preventative in nature until I was about 20 when a number of things happened in my life in quite quick succession really serious things which just flipped my life upside down and all of a sudden I was inundated with thoughts inundated with difficult emotions that I didnt know how to cope with Every time I sort of pushed one down another one would pop back up again It was a really very stressful time I guess we all deal with stress in different ways Some people will bury themselves in work grateful for the distraction Others will turn to their friends their family looking for support Some people hit the bottle start taking medication My own way of dealing with it was to become a monk So I quit my degree I headed off to the Himalayas I became a monk and I started studying meditation People often ask me what I learned from that time Well obviously it changed things Lets face it becoming a celibate monk is going to change a number of things But it was more than that It taught me  it gave me a greater appreciation an understanding for the present moment By that I mean not being lost in thought not being distracted not being overwhelmed by difficult emotions but instead learning how to be in the here and now how to be mindful how to be present I think the present moment is so underrated It sounds so ordinary and yet we spend so little time in the present moment that its anything but ordinary There was a research paper that came out of Harvard just recently that said on average our minds are lost in thought almost 47 percent of the time 47 percent At the same time this sort of constant mindwandering is also a direct cause of unhappiness Now were not here for that long anyway but to spend almost half of our life lost in thought and potentially quite unhappy I dont know it just kind of seems tragic actually especially when theres something we can do about it when theres a positive practical achievable scientifically proven technique which allows our mind to be more healthy to be more mindful and less distracted And the beauty of it is that even though it need only take about 10 minutes a day it impacts our entire life But we need to know how to do it We need an exercise We need a framework to learn how to be more mindful Thats essentially what meditation is Its familiarizing ourselves with the present moment But we also need to know how to approach it in the right way to get the best from it And thats what these are for in case youve been wondering because most people assume that meditation is all about stopping thoughts getting rid of emotions somehow controlling the mind but actually its quite different from that Its more about stepping back sort of seeing the thought clearly witnessing it coming and going emotions coming and going without judgment but with a relaxed focused mind So for example right now if I focus too much on the balls then theres no way I can relax and talk to you at the same time Equally if I relax too much talking to you theres no way I can focus on the balls Im going to drop them Now in life and in meditation therell be times when the focus becomes a little bit too intense and life starts to feel a bit like this Its a very uncomfortable way to live life when you get this tight and stressed At other times we might take our foot off the gas a little bit too much and things just become a sort of little bit like this Of course in meditation  were going to end up falling asleep So were looking for a balance a focused relaxation where we can allow thoughts to come and go without all the usual involvement Now what usually happens when were learning to be mindful is that we get distracted by a thought Lets say this is an anxious thought Everythings going fine and we see the anxious thought Oh I didnt realize I was worried about that You go back to it repeat it Oh I am worried I really am worried Wow theres so much anxiety And before we know it right were anxious about feeling anxious You know this is crazy We do this all the time even on an everyday level If you think about the last time you had a wobbly tooth You know its wobbly and you know that it hurts But what do you do every 20 30 seconds It does hurt And we reinforce the storyline right And we just keep telling ourselves and we do it all the time And its only in learning to watch the mind in this way that we can start to let go of those storylines and patterns of mind But when you sit down and you watch the mind in this way you might see many different patterns You might find a mind thats really restless and  the whole time Dont be surprised if you feel a bit agitated in your body when you sit down to do nothing and your mind feels like that You might find a mind thats very dull and boring and its just almost mechanical it just seems its as if youre getting up going to work eat sleep get up work Or it might just be that one little nagging thought that just goes round and round your mind Well whatever it is meditation offers the opportunity the potential to step back and to get a different perspective to see that things arent always as they appear We cant change every little thing that happens to us in life but we can change the way that we experience it Thats the potential of meditation of mindfulness You dont have to burn any incense and you definitely dont have to sit on the floor All you need to do is to take 10 minutes out a day to step back to familiarize yourself with the present moment so that you get to experience a greater sense of focus calm and clarity in your life Thank you very muchThere is nothing bigger or older than the universe The questions I would like to talk about are one where did we come from How did the universe come into being Are we alone in the universe Is there alien life out there What is the future of the human race Up until the 1920s everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time Then it was discovered that the universe was expanding Distant galaxies were moving away from us This meant they must have been closer together in the past If we extrapolate back we find we must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago This was the Big Bang the beginning of the universe But was there anything before the Big Bang If not what created the universe Why did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did We used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts First there were the laws like Maxwells equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe given its state over all of space at one time And second there was no question of the initial state of the universe We have made good progress on the first part and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions But until recently we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe However this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct Under extreme conditions general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space This removes the distinction between time and space and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state The universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing Moreover we can calculate a probability that the universe was created in different states These predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the WMAP satellite of the cosmic microwave background which is an imprint of the very early universe We think we have solved the mystery of creation Maybe we should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence I now turn to the second big question are we alone or is there other life in the universe We believe that life arose spontaneously on the Earth so it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planets of which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy But we dont know how life first appeared We have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing The first is that we have fossils of algae from 35 billion years ago The Earth was formed 46 billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years So life appeared on Earth within half a billion years of it being possible which is short compared to the 10billionyear lifetime of a planet of Earth type This suggests that the probability of life appearing is reasonably high If it was very low one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available On the other hand we dont seem to have been visited by aliens I am discounting the reports of UFOs Why would they appear only to cranks and weirdos If there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring it seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far Furthermore despite an extensive search by the SETI project we havent heard any alien television quiz shows This probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations at our stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light years Issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet This brings me to the last of the big questions the future of the human race If we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy we should make sure we survive and continue But we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history Our population and our use of the finite resources of planet Earth are growing exponentially along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill But our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were of survival advantage in the past It will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years let alone the next thousand or million Our only chance of longterm survival is not to remain inwardlooking on planet Earth but to spread out into space The answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years But if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years our future is in space That is why I am in favor of manned  or should I say personned  space flight All of my life I have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap Indeed it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge The ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe and we are making good progress Thank you for listening Chris Anderson Professor if you had to guess either way do you now believe that it is more likely than not that we are alone in the Milky Way as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher This answer took seven minutes and really gave me an insight into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for TED Stephen Hawking I think it quite likely that we are the only civilization within several hundred light years otherwise we would have heard radio waves The alternative is that civilizations dont last very long but destroy themselves CA Professor Hawking thank you for that answer We will take it as a salutary warning I think for the rest of our conference this week Professor we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made to share your questions with us today Thank you very much indeedAnd thats one of the things that I enjoy most about this convention Its not so much as so little has to do with what everything is But it is within our selfinterest to understand the topography of our lives unto ourselves The future states that there is no time other than the collapsation of that sensation of the mirror of the memories in which we are living Common knowledge but important nonetheless As we face fear in these times and fear is all around us we also have antifear Its hard to imagine or measure The background radiation is simply too static to be able to be seen under the normal spectral analysis But we feel as though there are times when a lot of us  you know what Im saying But  you know what Im saying Because as a hip hop thing you know what Im saying TED be rocking  you know what Im saying Like so I wrote a song and I hope you guys dig it Its a song about people and sasquatches  And other French science stuff Thats French science Okay here we go Ive been trying inside I know that Im in trouble that Im in trouble by myself But every time it gets me And Ive been trying to be the one that you believe in And youre the one that I want to be so saucy And youre the one I want to unclear baby And you can do anything as long as you dont get hurt along the way back If I survive Im going to tell you what is wrong Because if you were unclear And I think that youre looking like a unclear I give you what I want to be And its like you could use as many of those things that you want And the computer models no matter how many that you have and how many people that you use are never going to be able to arrive at the same conclusions Four years ago I worked with a few people at the Brookings Institute and I arrived at a conclusion Tomorrow is another day Not just any day but it is a day It will get here theres no question And the important thing to remember is that this simulation is a good one Its believable its tactile You can reach out  things are solid You can move objects from one area to another You can feel your body You can say Id like to go over to this location and you can move this mass of molecules through the air over to another location at will Thats something you live inside of every day Now with the allocation and the understanding of the lack of understanding we enter into a new era of science in which we feel nothing more than so much so as to say that those within themselves comporary or noncomporary will figuratively figure into the folding of our nonunderstanding and our partial understanding to the networks of which we all draw our source and conclusions from So as I say before the last piece feel not as though it is a sphere we live on rather an infinite plane which has the illusion of leading yourself back to the point of origin Once we understand that all the spheres in the sky are just large infinite planes it will be plain to see This is my final piece And just remember everything you are  its more important to realize the negative space as music is only the division of space it is the space we are listening to divided as such which gives us the information in comparison to something other that gives us the idea of what the idea that wants to be transmitted wants to be So please without further ado Thank you This is a fun one It goes like this Okay for the last piece Id like to do this one goes very similar to this I hope you guys recognize it Here we go Okay that still works Okay good All right here we go Here we go Yeah yo yo yo Thank you Enjoy the restHello Id like to show you guys 30 seconds of the best day of my life So that was El Capitan in Californias Yosemite National Park and in case you couldnt tell I was climbing by myself without a rope a style of a climbing known as free soloing That was the culmination of a nearly decadelong dream and in the video Im over 2500 feet off the ground Seems scary Yeah it is which is why I spent so many years dreaming about soloing El Cap and not actually doing it But on the day that that video was taken it didnt feel scary at all It felt as comfortable and natural as a walk in the park which is what most folks were doing in Yosemite that day Today Id like to talk about how I was able to feel so comfortable and how I overcame my fear Ill start with a very brief version of how I became a climber and then tell the story of my two most significant free solos They were both successful which is why Im here But the first felt largely unsatisfying whereas the second El Cap was by far the most fulfilling day of my life Through these two climbs youll see my process for managing fear So I started climbing in a gym when I was around 10 years old which means that my life has been centered on climbing for more than 20 years After nearly a decade of climbing mostly indoors I made the transition to the outdoors and gradually started free soloing I built up my comfort over time and slowly took on bigger and more challenging walls And there have been many free soloists before me so I had plenty of inspiration to draw from But by 2008 Id repeated most of their previous solos in Yosemite and was starting to imagine breaking into new terrain The obvious first choice was Half Dome an iconic 2000foot wall that lords over the east end of the valley The problem though also the allure was that it was too big I didnt really know how to prepare for a potential free solo So I decided to skip the preparations and just go up there and have an adventure I figured I would rise to the occasion which unsurprisingly was not the best strategy I did at least climb the route roped up with a friend two days before just to make sure that I knew roughly where to go and that I could physically do it But when I came back by myself two days later I decided that I didnt want to go that way I knew that there was a 300foot variation that circled around one of the hardest parts of the climb I suddenly decided to skip the hard part and take the variation even though Id never climbed it before but I immediately began to doubt myself Imagine being by yourself in the dead center of a 2000foot face wondering if youre lost Thankfully it was pretty much the right way and I circled back to the route I was slightly rattled I was pretty rattled but I tried not to let it bother me too much because I knew that all the hardest climbing was up at the top I needed to stay composed It was a beautiful September morning and as I climbed higher I could hear the sounds of tourists chatting and laughing on the summit Theyd all hiked up the normal trail on the back which I was planning on using for my descent But between me and the summit lay a blank slab of granite There were no cracks or edges to hold on to just small ripples of texture up a slightly less than vertical wall I had to trust my life to the friction between my climbing shoes and the smooth granite I carefully balanced my way upward shifting my weight back and forth between the small smears But then I reached a foothold that I didnt quite trust Two days ago Id have just stepped right up on it but that would have been with a rope on Now it felt too small and too slippery I doubted that my foot would stay on if I weighted it I considered a foot further to the side which seemed worse I switched my feet and tried a foot further out It seemed even worse I started to panic I could hear people laughing on the summit just above me I wanted to be anywhere but on that slab My mind was racing in every direction I knew what I had to do but I was too afraid to do it I just had to stand up on my right foot And so after what felt like an eternity I accepted what I had to do and I stood up on the right foot and it didnt slip and so I didnt die and that move marked the end of the hardest climbing And so I charged from there towards the summit And so normally when you summit Half Dome you have a rope and a bunch of climbing gear on you and tourists gasp and they flock around you for photos This time I popped over the edge shirtless panting jacked I was amped but nobody batted an eye I looked like a lost hiker that was too close to the edge I was surrounded by people talking on cell phones and having picnics I felt like I was in a mall I took off my tight climbing shoes and started hiking back down and thats when people stopped me Youre hiking barefoot Thats so hardcore I didnt bother to explain but that night in my climbing journal I duly noted my free solo of Half Dome but I included a frowny face and a comment Do better Id succeeded in the solo and it was celebrated as a big first in climbing Some friends later made a film about it But I was unsatisfied I was disappointed in my performance because I knew that I had gotten away with something I didnt want to be a lucky climber I wanted to be a great climber I actually took the next year or so off from free soloing because I knew that I shouldnt make a habit of relying on luck But even though I wasnt soloing very much Id already started to think about El Cap It was always in the back of my mind as the obvious crown jewel of solos Its the most striking wall in the world Each year for the next seven years Id think This is the year that Im going to solo El Cap And then I would drive into Yosemite look up at the wall and think No frickin way Its too big and too scary But eventually I came to accept that I wanted to test myself against El Cap It represented true mastery but I needed it to feel different I didnt want to get away with anything or barely squeak by This time I wanted to do it right The thing that makes El Cap so intimidating is the sheer scale of the wall Most climbers take three to five days to ascend the 3000 feet of vertical granite The idea of setting out up a wall of that size with nothing but shoes and a chalk bag seemed impossible 3000 feet of climbing represents thousands of distinct hand and foot movements which is a lot to remember Many of the moves I knew through sheer repetition Id climbed El Cap maybe 50 times over the previous decade with a rope But this photo shows my preferred method of rehearsing the moves Im on the summit about to rappel down the face with over a thousand feet of rope to spend the day practicing Once I found sequences that felt secure and repeatable I had to memorize them I had to make sure that they were so deeply ingrained within me that there was no possibility of error I didnt want to be wondering if I was going the right way or using the best holds I needed everything to feel automatic Climbing with a rope is a largely physical effort You just have to be strong enough to hold on and make the movements upward But free soloing plays out more in the mind The physical effort is largely the same Your body is still climbing the same wall But staying calm and performing at your best when you know that any mistake could mean death requires a certain kind of mindset Thats not supposed to be funny but if it is it is I worked to cultivate that mindset through visualization which basically just means imagining the entire experience of soloing the wall Partially that was to help me remember all the holds but mostly visualization was about feeling the texture of each hold in my hand and imagining the sensation of my leg reaching out and placing my foot just so Id imagine it all like a choreographed dance thousands of feet up The most difficult part of the whole route was called the Boulder Problem It was about 2000 feet off the ground and consisted of the hardest physical moves on the whole route long pulls between poor handholds with very small slippery feet This is what I mean by a poor handhold an edge smaller than the width of a pencil but facing downward that I had to press up into with my thumb But that wasnt even the hardest part The crux culminated in a karate kick with my left foot over to the inside of an adjacent corner a maneuver that required a high degree of precision and flexibility enough so that Id been doing a nightly stretching routine for a full year ahead of time to make sure that I could comfortably make the reach with my leg As I practiced the moves my visualization turned to the emotional component of a potential solo Basically what if I got up there and it was too scary What if I was too tired What if I couldnt quite make the kick I had to consider every possibility while I was safely on the ground so that when the time came and I was actually making the moves without a rope there was no room for doubt to creep in Doubt is the precursor to fear and I knew that I couldnt experience my perfect moment if I was afraid I had to visualize and rehearse enough to remove all doubt But beyond that I also visualized how it would feel if it never seemed doable What if after so much work I was afraid to try What if I was wasting my time and I would never feel comfortable in such an exposed position There were no easy answers but El Cap meant enough to me that I would put in the work and find out Some of my preparations were more mundane This is a photo of my friend Conrad Anker climbing up the bottom of El Cap with an empty backpack We spent the day climbing together to a specific crack in the middle of the wall that was choked with loose rocks that made that section difficult and potentially dangerous because any missed step might knock a rock to the ground and kill a passing climber or hiker So we carefully removed the rocks loaded them into the pack and rappelled back down Take a second to imagine how ridiculous it feels to climb 1500 feet up a wall just to fill a backpack full of rocks Its never that easy to carry a pack full of rocks around Its even harder on the side of a cliff It may have felt silly but it still had to get done I needed everything to feel perfect if I was ever going to climb the route without a rope After two seasons of working specifically toward a potential free solo of El Cap I finally finished all my preparations I knew every handhold and foothold on the whole route and I knew exactly what to do Basically I was ready It was time to solo El Cap On June 3 2017 I woke up early ate my usual breakfast of muesli and fruit and made it to the base of the wall before sunrise I felt confident as I looked up the wall I felt even better as I started climbing About 500 feet up I reached a slab very similar to the one that had given me so much trouble on Half Dome but this time was different Id scouted every option including hundreds of feet of wall to either side I knew exactly what to do and how to do it I had no doubts I just climbed right through Even the difficult and strenuous sections passed by with ease I was perfectly executing my routine I rested for a moment below the Boulder Problem and then climbed it just as I had practiced so many times with the rope on My foot shot across to the wall on the left without hesitation and I knew that I had done it Climbing Half Dome had been a big goal and I did it but I didnt get what I really wanted I didnt achieve mastery I was hesitant and afraid and it wasnt the experience that I wanted But El Cap was different With 600 feet to go I felt like the mountain was offering me a victory lap I climbed with a smooth precision and enjoyed the sounds of the birds swooping around the cliff It all felt like a celebration And then I reached the summit after three hours and 56 minutes of glorious climbing It was the climb that I wanted and it felt like mastery Thank youWe are losing our listening We spend roughly 60 percent of our communication time listening but were not very good at it We retain just 25 percent of what we hear Now  not you not this talk but that is generally true Lets define listening as making meaning from sound Its a mental process and its a process of extraction We use some pretty cool techniques to do this One of them is pattern recognition So in a cocktail party like this if I say David Sara pay attention  some of you just sat up We recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal and especially our name Differencing is another technique we use If I left this pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes you would literally cease to hear it We listen to differences we discount sounds that remain the same And then there is a whole range of filters These filters take us from all sound down to what we pay attention to Most people are entirely unconscious of these filters But they actually create our reality in a way because they tell us what were paying attention to right now Ill give you one example of that Intention is very important in sound in listening When I married my wife I promised her I would listen to her every day as if for the first time Now thats something I fall short of on a daily basis But its a great intention to have in a relationship But thats not all Sound places us in space and in time If you close your eyes right now in this room youre aware of the size of the room from the reverberation and the bouncing of the sound off the surfaces youre aware of how many people are around you because of the micronoises youre receiving And sound places us in time as well because sound always has time embedded in it In fact I would suggest that our listening is the main way that we experience the flow of time from past to future So Sonority is time and meaning  a great quote I said at the beginning were losing our listening Why did I say that Well there are a lot of reasons for this First of all we invented ways of recording  first writing then audio recording and now video recording as well The premium on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared Secondly the world is now so noisy with this cacophony going on visually and auditorily its just hard to listen its tiring to listen Many people take refuge in headphones but they turn big public spaces like this shared soundscapes into millions of tiny little personal sound bubbles In this scenario nobodys listening to anybody Were becoming impatient We dont want oratory anymore we want sound bites And the art of conversation is being replaced  dangerously I think  by personal broadcasting I dont know how much listening there is in this conversation which is sadly very common especially in the UK Were becoming desensitized Our media have to scream at us with these kinds of headlines in order to get our attention And that means its harder for us to pay attention to the quiet the subtle the understated This is a serious problem that were losing our listening This is not trivial because listening is our access to understanding Conscious listening always creates understanding and only without conscious listening can these things happen A world where we dont listen to each other at all is a very scary place indeed So Id like to share with you five simple exercises tools you can take away with you to improve your own conscious listening Would you like that Audience Yes Good The first one is silence Just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to reset your ears and to recalibrate so that you can hear the quiet again If you cant get absolute silence go for quiet thats absolutely fine Second I call this the mixer So even if youre in a noisy environment like this  and we all spend a lot of time in places like this  listen in the coffee bar to how many channels of sound can I hear How many individual channels in that mix am I listening to You can do it in a beautiful place as well like in a lake How many birds am I hearing Where are they Where are those ripples Its a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening Third this exercise I call savoring and this is a beautiful exercise Its about enjoying mundane sounds This for example is my tumble dryer Its a waltz  one two three one two three one two three I love it Or just try this one on for size Wow So mundane sounds can be really interesting  if you pay attention I call that the hidden choir  its around us all the time The next exercise is probably the most important of all of these if you just take one thing away This is listening positions  the idea that you can move your listening position to whats appropriate to what youre listening to This is playing with those filters Remember I gave you those filters Its starting to play with them as levers to get conscious about them and to move to different places These are just some of the listening positions or scales of listening positions that you can use There are many Have fun with that Its very exciting And finally an acronym You can use this in listening in communication If youre in any one of those roles  and I think that probably is everybody whos listening to this talk  the acronym is RASA which is the Sanskrit word for juice or essence And RASA stands for Receive which means pay attention to the person Appreciate making little noises like hmm oh OK Summarize  the word so is very important in communication and Ask ask questions afterwards Now sound is my passion its my life I wrote a whole book about it So I live to listen Thats too much to ask for most people But I believe that every human being needs to listen consciously in order to live fully  connected in space and in time to the physical world around us connected in understanding to each other not to mention spiritually connected because every spiritual path I know of has listening and contemplation at its heart Thats why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill Why is it not taught Its crazy And if we can teach listening in our schools we can take our listening off that slippery slope to that dangerous scary world that I talked about and move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time or at least capable of doing it Now I dont know how to do that but this is TED and I think the TED community is capable of anything So I invite you to connect with me connect with each other take this mission out And lets get listening taught in schools and transform the world in one generation to a conscious listening world  a world of connection a world of understanding and a world of peace Thank you for listening to me todaySo in college I was a government major which means I had to write a lot of papers Now when a normal student writes a paper they might spread the work out a little like this So you know  you get started maybe a little slowly but you get enough done in the first week that with some heavier days later on everything gets done things stay civil And I would want to do that like that That would be the plan I would have it all ready to go but then actually the paper would come along and then I would kind of do this And that would happen every single paper But then came my 90page senior thesis a paper youre supposed to spend a year on And I knew for a paper like that my normal work flow was not an option It was way too big a project So I planned things out and I decided I kind of had to go something like this This is how the year would go So Id start off light and Id bump it up in the middle months and then at the end I would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase How hard could it be to walk up the stairs No big deal right But then the funniest thing happened Those first few months They came and went and I couldnt quite do stuff So we had an awesome new revised plan And then  But then those middle months actually went by and I didnt really write words and so we were here And then two months turned into one month which turned into two weeks And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline still not having written a word and so I did the only thing I could I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours pulling not one but two allnighters  humans are not supposed to pull two allnighters  sprinted across campus dove in slow motion and got it in just at the deadline I thought that was the end of everything But a week later I get a call and its the school And they say Is this Tim Urban And I say Yeah And they say We need to talk about your thesis And I say OK And they say Its the best one weve ever seen That did not happen It was a very very bad thesis I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought This guy is amazing footnote footnote No no it was very very bad Anyway today Im a writerblogger guy I write the blog Wait But Why And a couple of years ago I decided to write about procrastination My behavior has always perplexed the nonprocrastinators around me and I wanted to explain to the nonprocrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators and why we are the way we are Now I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people And to test this I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven nonprocrastinator so I could compare them I actually brought them here to show you today I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference I know that if youre not a trained brain expert its not that obvious but just take a look OK So heres the brain of a nonprocrastinator Now  heres my brain There is a difference Both brains have a Rational DecisionMaker in them but the procrastinators brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey Now what does this mean for the procrastinator Well it means everythings fine until this happens This is a perfect time to get some work done Nope So the Rational DecisionMaker will make the rational decision to do something productive but the Monkey doesnt like that plan so he actually takes the wheel and he says Actually lets read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan Tonya Harding scandal because I just remembered that that happened Then  Then were going to go over to the fridge to see if theres anything new in there since 10 minutes ago After that were going to go on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much much later with us watching interviews with Justin Biebers mom All of thats going to take a while so were not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today Sorry Now what is going on here The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel He lives entirely in the present moment He has no memory of the past no knowledge of the future and he only cares about two things easy and fun Now in the animal world that works fine If youre a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things youre a huge success And to the Monkey humans are just another animal species You have to keep wellslept wellfed and propagating into the next generation which in tribal times might have worked OK But if you havent noticed now were not in tribal times Were in an advanced civilization and the Monkey does not know what that is Which is why we have another guy in our brain the Rational DecisionMaker who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do We can visualize the future We can see the big picture We can make longterm plans And he wants to take all of that into account And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now Now sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun like when youre having dinner or going to bed or enjoying wellearned leisure time Thats why theres an overlap Sometimes they agree But other times it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant for the sake of the big picture And thats when we have a conflict And for the procrastinator that conflict tends to end a certain way every time leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone an easy and fun place thats entirely out of the Makes Sense circle I call it the Dark Playground Now the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well Its where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening The fun you have in the Dark Playground isnt actually fun because its completely unearned and the air is filled with guilt dread anxiety selfhatred  all of those good procrastinator feelings And the question is in this situation with the Monkey behind the wheel how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone a less pleasant place but where really important things happen Well turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel someone whos always looking down on him and watching over him in his darkest moments  someone called the Panic Monster Now the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close or theres danger of public embarrassment a career disaster or some other scary consequence And importantly hes the only thing the Monkey is terrified of Now he became very relevant in my life pretty recently because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk Now of course I said yes Its always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past But in the middle of all this excitement the Rational DecisionMaker seemed to have something else on his mind He was saying Are we clear on what we just accepted Do we get whats going to be now happening one day in the future We need to sit down and work on this right now And the Monkey said Totally agree but lets just open Google Earth and zoom in to the bottom of India like 200 feet above the ground and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country so we can get a better feel for India So thats what we did that day As six months turned into four and then two and then one the people of TED decided to release the speakers And I opened up the website and there was my face staring right back at me And guess who woke up So the Panic Monster starts losing his mind and a few seconds later the whole systems in mayhem And the Monkey  remember hes terrified of the Panic Monster  boom hes up the tree And finally finally the Rational DecisionMaker can take the wheel and I can start working on the talk Now the Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages And this entire situation with the three characters  this is the procrastinators system Its not pretty but in the end it works This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago When I did I was amazed by the response Literally thousands of emails came in from all different kinds of people from all over the world doing all different kinds of things These are people who were nurses bankers painters engineers and lots and lots of PhD students And they were all writing saying the same thing I have this problem too But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives about what this Monkey had done to them And I thought about this and I said well if the procrastinators system works then whats going on Why are all of these people in such a dark place Well it turns out that theres two kinds of procrastination Everything Ive talked about today the examples Ive given they all have deadlines And when theres deadlines the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved But theres a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline So if you wanted a career where youre a selfstarter  something in the arts something entrepreneurial  theres no deadlines on those things at first because nothings happening not until youve gone out and done the hard work to get momentum get things going Theres also all kinds of important things outside of your career that dont involve any deadlines like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship that isnt working Now if the procrastinators only mechanism of doing these hard things is the Panic Monster thats a problem because in all of these nondeadline situations the Panic Monster doesnt show up He has nothing to wake up for so the effects of procrastination theyre not contained they just extend outward forever And its this longterm kind of procrastination thats much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier shortterm deadlinebased kind Its usually suffered quietly and privately And it can be the source of a huge amount of longterm unhappiness and regrets And I thought thats why those people are emailing and thats why theyre in such a bad place Its not that theyre cramming for some project Its that longterm procrastination has made them feel like a spectator at times in their own lives The frustration is not that they couldnt achieve their dreams its that they werent even able to start chasing them So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany  that I dont think nonprocrastinators exist Thats right  I think all of you are procrastinators Now you might not all be a mess like some of us and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines but remember the Monkeys sneakiest trick is when the deadlines arent there footnote footnote Now I want to show you one last thing I call this a Life Calendar Thats one box for every week of a 90year life Thats not that many boxes especially since weve already used a bunch of those So I think we need to all take a long hard look at that calendar We need to think about what were really procrastinating on because everyone is procrastinating on something in life We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey Thats a job for all of us And because theres not that many boxes on there its a job that should probably start today Well maybe not today but  You know Sometime soon Thank youSo in college I was a government major which means I had to write a lot of papers Now when

does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel He lives entirely in the present moment He has no memory of the past no knowledge of the future and he only cares about two things easy and fun Now in the animal world that works fine If youre a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things youre a huge success And to the Monkey humans are just another animal species You have to keep wellslept wellfed and propagating into the next generation which in tribal times might have worked OK But if you havent noticed now were not in tribal times Were in an advanced civilization and the Monkey does not know what that is Which is why we have another guy in our brain the Rational DecisionMaker who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do We can visualize the future We can see the big picture We can make longterm plans And he wants to take all of that into account And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now Now sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun like when youre having dinner or going to bed or enjoying wellearned leisure time Thats why theres an overlap Sometimes they agree But other times it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant for the sake of the big picture And thats when we have a conflict And for the procrastinator that conflict tends to end a certain way every time leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone an easy and fun place thats entirely out of the Makes Sense circle I call it the Dark Playground Now the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well Its where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening The fun you have in the Dark Playground isnt actually fun because its completely unearned and the air is filled with guilt dread anxiety selfhatred  all of those good procrastinator feelings And the question is in this situation with the Monkey behind the wheel how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone a less pleasant place but where really important things happen Well turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel someone whos always looking down on him and watching over him in his darkest moments  someone called the Panic Monster Now the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close or theres danger of public embarrassment a career disaster or some other scary consequence And importantly hes the only thing the Monkey is terrified of Now he became very relevant in my life pretty recently because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk Now of course I said yes Its always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past But in the middle of all this excitement the Rational DecisionMaker seemed to have something else on his mind He was saying Are we clear on what we just accepted Do we get whats going to be now happening one day in the future We need to sit down and work on this right now And the Monkey said Totally agree but lets just open Google Earth and zoom in to the bottom of India like 200 feet above the ground and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country so we can get a better feel for India So thats what we did that day As six months turned into four and then two and then one the people of TED decided to release the speakers And I opened up the website and there was my face staring right back at me And guess who woke up So the Panic Monster starts losing his mind and a few seconds later the whole systems in mayhem And the Monkey  remember hes terrified of the Panic Monster  boom hes up the tree And finally finally the Rational DecisionMaker can take the wheel and I can start working on the talk Now the Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages And this entire situation with the three characters  this is the procrastinators system Its not pretty but in the end it works This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago When I did I was amazed by the response Literally thousands of emails came in from all different kinds of people from all over the world doing all different kinds of things These are people who were nurses bankers painters engineers and lots and lots of PhD students And they were all writing saying the same thing I have this problem too But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives about what this Monkey had done to them And I thought about this and I said well if the procrastinators system works then whats going on Why are all of these people in such a dark place Well it turns out that theres two kinds of procrastination Everything Ive talked about today the examples Ive given they all have deadlines And when theres deadlines the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved But theres a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline So if you wanted a career where youre a selfstarter  something in the arts something entrepreneurial  theres no deadlines on those things at first because nothings happening not until youve gone out and done the hard work to get momentum get things going Theres also all kinds of important things outside of your career that dont involve any deadlines like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship that isnt working Now if the procrastinators only mechanism of doing these hard things is the Panic Monster thats a problem because in all of these nondeadline situations the Panic Monster doesnt show up He has nothing to wake up for so the effects of procrastination theyre not contained they just extend outward forever And its this longterm kind of procrastination thats much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier shortterm deadlinebased kind Its usually suffered quietly and privately And it can be the source of a huge amount of longterm unhappiness and regrets And I thought thats why those people are emailing and thats why theyre in such a bad place Its not that theyre cramming for some project Its that longterm procrastination has made them feel like a spectator at times in their own lives The frustration is not that they couldnt achieve their dreams its that they werent even able to start chasing them So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany  that I dont think nonprocrastinators exist Thats right  I think all of you are procrastinators Now you might not all be a mess like some of us and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines but remember the Monkeys sneakiest trick is when the deadlines arent there footnote footnote Now I want to show you one last thing I call this a Life Calendar Thats one box for every week of a 90year life Thats not that many boxes especially since weve already used a bunch of those So I think we need to all take a long hard look at that calendar We need to think about what were really procrastinating on because everyone is procrastinating on something in life We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey Thats a job for all of us And because theres not that many boxes on there its a job that should probably start today Well maybe not today but  You know Sometime soon Thank youWhat keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life If you were going to invest now in your future best self where would you put your time and your energy There was a recent survey of millennials asking them what their most important life goals were and over 80 percent said that a major life goal for them was to get rich And another 50 percent of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous And were constantly told to lean in to work to push harder and achieve more Were given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life Pictures of entire lives of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them those pictures are almost impossible to get Most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past and as we know hindsight is anything but 2020 We forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life and sometimes memory is downright creative But what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time What if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy We did that The Harvard Study of Adult Development may be the longest study of adult life thats ever been done For 75 years weve tracked the lives of 724 men year after year asking about their work their home lives their health and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out Studies like this are exceedingly rare Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study or funding for the research dries up or the researchers get distracted or they die and nobody moves the ball further down the field But through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived About 60 of our original 724 men are still alive still participating in the study most of them in their 90s And we are now beginning to study the more than 2000 children of these men And Im the fourth director of the study Since 1938 weve tracked the lives of two groups of men The first group started in the study when they were sophomores at Harvard College They all finished college during World War II and then most went off to serve in the war And the second group that weve followed was a group of boys from Bostons poorest neighborhoods boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the Boston of the 1930s Most lived in tenements many without hot and cold running water When they entered the study all of these teenagers were interviewed They were given medical exams We went to their homes and we interviewed their parents And then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life They became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors one President of the United States Some developed alcoholism A few developed schizophrenia Some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top and some made that journey in the opposite direction The founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that I would be standing here today 75 years later telling you that the study still continues Every two years our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives Many of the inner city Boston men ask us Why do you keep wanting to study me My life just isnt that interesting The Harvard men never ask that question To get the clearest picture of these lives we dont just send them questionnaires We interview them in their living rooms We get their medical records from their doctors We draw their blood we scan their brains we talk to their children We videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns And when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study many of the women said You know its about time So what have we learned What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that weve generated on these lives Well the lessons arent about wealth or fame or working harder and harder The clearest message that we get from this 75year study is this Good relationships keep us happier and healthier Period Weve learned three big lessons about relationships The first is that social connections are really good for us and that loneliness kills It turns out that people who are more socially connected to family to friends to community are happier theyre physically healthier and they live longer than people who are less well connected And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic People who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy their health declines earlier in midlife their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely And the sad fact is that at any given time more than one in five Americans will report that theyre lonely And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage so the second big lesson that we learned is that its not just the number of friends you have and its not whether or not youre in a committed relationship but its the quality of your close relationships that matters It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health Highconflict marriages for example without much affection turn out to be very bad for our health perhaps worse than getting divorced And living in the midst of good warm relationships is protective Once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy healthy octogenarian and who wasnt And when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50 it wasnt their middle age cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old It was how satisfied they were in their relationships The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80 And good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old Our most happily partnered men and women reported in their 80s that on the days when they had more physical pain their mood stayed just as happy But the people who were in unhappy relationships on the days when they reported more physical pain it was magnified by more emotional pain And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health is that good relationships dont just protect our bodies they protect our brains It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your 80s is protective that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need those peoples memories stay sharper longer And the people in relationships where they feel they really cant count on the other one those are the people who experience earlier memory decline And those good relationships they dont have to be smooth all the time Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough those arguments didnt take a toll on their memories So this message that good close relationships are good for our health and wellbeing this is wisdom thats as old as the hills Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore Well were human What wed really like is a quick fix something we can get thatll make our lives good and keep them that way Relationships are messy and theyre complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends its not sexy or glamorous Its also lifelong It never ends The people in our 75year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates Just like the millennials in that recent survey many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life But over and over over these 75 years our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships with family with friends with community So what about you Lets say youre 25 or youre 40 or youre 60 What might leaning in to relationships even look like Well the possibilities are practically endless It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together long walks or date nights or reaching out to that family member who you havent spoken to in years because those alltoocommon family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges Id like to close with a quote from Mark Twain More than a century ago he was looking back on his life and he wrote this There isnt time so brief is life for bickerings apologies heartburnings callings to account There is only time for loving and but an instant so to speak for that The good life is built with good relationships Thank youAlright Im going to show you a couple of images from a very diverting paper in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine Im going to go way out on a limb and say that it is the most diverting paper ever published in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine The title is Observations of InUtero Masturbation footnote footnote Okay Now on the left you can see the hand  thats the big arrow  and the penis on the right The hand hovering And over here we have in the words of radiologist Israel Meisner The hand grasping the penis in a fashion resembling masturbation movements Bear in mind this was an ultrasound so it would have been moving images footnote footnote Orgasm is a reflex of the autonomic nervous system Now this is the part of the nervous system that deals with the things that we dont consciously control like digestion heart rate and sexual arousal And the orgasm reflex can be triggered by a surprisingly broad range of input Genital stimulation Duh But also Kinsey interviewed a woman who could be brought to orgasm by having someone stroke her eyebrow People with spinal cord injuries like paraplegias quadriplegias will often develop a very very sensitive area right above the level of their injury wherever that is There is such a thing as a knee orgasm in the literature I think the most curious one that I came across was a case report of a woman who had an orgasm every time she brushed her teeth footnote footnote Something in the complex sensorymotor action of brushing her teeth was triggering orgasm And she went to a neurologist who was fascinated He checked to see if it was something in the toothpaste but no  it happened with any brand They stimulated her gums with a toothpick to see if that was doing it No It was the whole you know motion And the amazing thing to me is that you would think this woman would have excellent oral hygiene Sadly  this is what it said in the journal paper  She believed that she was possessed by demons and switched to mouthwash for her oral care Its so sad When I was working on the book I interviewed a woman who can think herself to orgasm She was part of a study at Rutgers University Youve got to love that Rutgers So I interviewed her in Oakland in a sushi restaurant And I said So could you do it right here And she said Yeah but you know Id rather finish my meal if you dont mind But afterwards she was kind enough to demonstrate on a bench outside It was remarkable It took about one minute And I said to her Are you just doing this all the time She said No Honestly when I get home Im usually too tired She said that the last time she had done it was on the Disneyland tram The headquarters for orgasm along the spinal nerve is something called the sacral nerve root which is back here And if you trigger if you stimulate with an electrode the precise spot you will trigger an orgasm And it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes in dead people  a certain kind of dead person a beatingheart cadaver Now this is somebody who is braindead legally dead definitely checked out but is being kept alive on a respirator so that their organs will be oxygenated for transplantation Now in one of these braindead people if you trigger the right spot you will see something every now and then There is a reflex called the Lazarus reflex And this is  Ill demonstrate as best I can not being dead Its like this You trigger the spot The dead guy or gal goes like that Very unsettling for people working in pathology labs Now if you can trigger the Lazarus reflex in a dead person why not the orgasm reflex I asked this question to a brain death expert Stephanie Mann who was foolish enough to return my emails I said So could you conceivably trigger an orgasm in a dead person She said Yes if the sacral nerve is being oxygenated you conceivably could Obviously it wouldnt be as much fun for the person But it would be an orgasm  nonetheless There is a researcher at the University of Alabama who does orgasm research I said to her You should do an experiment You know You can get cadavers if you work at a university I said You should actually do this She said You get the human subjects review board approval for this one According to 1930s marriage manual author Theodoor van De Velde a slight seminal odor can be detected on the breath of a woman within about an hour after sexual intercourse Theodoor van De Velde was something of a semen connoisseur This is a guy writing a book Ideal Marriage you know Very heavy hetero guy But he wrote in this book Ideal Marriage  he said that he could differentiate between the semen of a young man which he said had a fresh exhilarating smell and the semen of mature men whose semen smelled quote Remarkably like that of the flowers of the Spanish chestnut Sometimes quite freshly floral and then again sometimes extremely pungent footnote footnote Okay In 1999 in the state of Israel a man began hiccupping And this was one of those cases that went on and on He tried everything his friends suggested Nothing seemed to help Days went by At a certain point the man still hiccupping had sex with his wife And lo and behold the hiccups went away He told his doctor who published a case report in a Canadian medical journal under the title Sexual Intercourse as a Potential Treatment for Intractable Hiccups I love this article because at a certain point they suggested that unattached hiccuppers could try masturbation I love that because there is like a whole demographic unattached hiccuppers Married single unattached hiccupper In the 1900s early 1900s a lot of gynecologists believed that when a woman has an orgasm the contractions serve to suck the semen up through the cervix and sort of deliver it really quickly to the egg thereby upping the odds of conception It was called the upsuck theory footnote footnote If you go all the way back to Hippocrates physicians believed that orgasm in women was not just helpful for conception but necessary Doctors back then were routinely telling men the importance of pleasuring their wives Marriagemanual author and semensniffer Theodoor van De Velde  has a line in his book I loved this guy I got a lot of mileage out of Theodoor van De Velde He had this line in his book that supposedly comes from the Habsburg Monarchy where there was an empress Maria Theresa who was having trouble conceiving And apparently the royal court physician said to her I am of the opinion that the vulva of your most sacred majesty be titillated for some time prior to intercourse Its apparently I dont know on the record somewhere Masters and Johnson now were moving forward to the 1950s Masters and Johnson were upsuck skeptics which is also really fun to say They didnt buy it And they decided being Masters and Johnson that they would get to the bottom of it They brought women into the lab  I think it was five women  and outfitted them with cervical caps containing artificial semen And in the artificial semen was a radioopaque substance such that it would show up on an Xray This is the 1950s Anyway these women sat in front of an Xray device And they masturbated And Masters and Johnson looked to see if the semen was being sucked up Did not find any evidence of upsuck You may be wondering How do you make artificial semen I have an answer for you I have two answers You can use flour and water or cornstarch and water I actually found three separate recipes in the literature My favorite being the one that says  you know they have the ingredients listed and then in a recipe it will say for example Yield two dozen cupcakes This one said Yield one ejaculate Theres another way that orgasm might boost fertility This one involves men Sperm that sit around in the body for a week or more start to develop abnormalities that make them less effective at headbanging their way into the egg British sexologist Roy Levin has speculated that this is perhaps why men evolved to be such enthusiastic and frequent masturbators He said If I keep tossing myself off I get fresh sperm being made Which I thought was an interesting idea theory So now you have an evolutionary excuse Okay All righty There is considerable evidence for upsuck in the animal kingdom  pigs for instance In Denmark the Danish National Committee for Pig Production found out that if you sexually stimulate a sow while you artificially inseminate her you will see a sixpercent increase in the farrowing rate which is the number of piglets produced So they came up with this fivepoint stimulation plan for the sows There is posters they put in the barn and they have a DVD And I got a copy of this DVD This is my unveiling because I am going to show you a clip So okay Now here we go la la la off to work It all looks very innocent Hes going to be doing things with his hands that the boar would use his snout lacking hands Okay This is it The boar has a very odd courtship repertoire This is to mimic the weight of the boar You should know the clitoris of the pig is inside the vagina So this may be sort of titillating for her Here we go And the happy result I love this video There is a point in this video towards the beginning where they zoom in for a close up of his hand with his wedding ring as if to say Its okay its just his job He really does like women Okay When I was in Denmark my host was named Anne Marie And I said So why dont you just stimulate the clitoris of the pig Why dont you have the farmers do that Thats not one of your five steps I have to read you what she said because I love it She said It was a big hurdle just to get farmers to touch underneath the vulva So we thought lets not mention the clitoris right now Shy but ambitious pig farmers however can purchase a  this is true  a sow vibrator that hangs on the sperm feeder tube to vibrate Because as I mentioned the clitoris is inside the vagina So possibly you know a little more arousing than it looks And I also said to her Now these sows I mean you may have noticed there The sow doesnt look to be in the throes of ecstasy And she said you cant make that conclusion because animals dont register pain or pleasure on their faces in the same way that we do Pigs for example are more like dogs They use the upper half of the face the ears are very expressive So youre not really sure whats going on with the pig Primates on the other hand we use our mouths more This is the ejaculation face of the stumptailed macaque And interestingly this has been observed in female macaques but only when mounting another female footnote footnote Masters and Johnson In the 1950s they decided okay were going to figure out the entire human sexual response cycle from arousal all the way through orgasm in men and women  everything that happens in the human body Okay with women a lot of this is happening inside This did not stop Masters and Johnson They developed an artificial coition machine This is basically a penis camera on a motor There is a phallus clear acrylic phallus with a camera and a light source attached to a motor that is kind of going like this And the woman would have sex with it That is what they would do Pretty amazing Sadly this device has been dismantled This just kills me not because I wanted to use it  I wanted to see it One fine day Alfred Kinsey decided to calculate the average distance traveled by ejaculated semen This was not idle curiosity Doctor Kinsey had heard  and there was a theory going around at the time this being the 1940s  that the force with which semen is thrown against the cervix was a factor in fertility Kinsey thought it was bunk so he got to work He got together in his lab 300 men a measuring tape and a movie camera And in fact he found that in three quarters of the men the stuff just kind of slopped out It wasnt spurted or thrown or ejected under great force However the record holder landed just shy of the eightfoot mark which is impressive Yes Exactly Sadly hes anonymous His name is not mentioned In his writeup of this experiment in his book Kinsey wrote Two sheets were laid down to protect the oriental carpets Which is my second favorite line in the entire oeuvre of Alfred Kinsey My favorite being Cheese crumbs spread before a pair of copulating rats will distract the female but not the male Thank you very much ThanksAlright Im going to show you a couple of images from a very diverting paper in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine

right now Shy but ambitious pig farmers however can purchase a  this is true  a sow vibrator that hangs on the sperm feeder tube to vibrate Because as I mentioned the clitoris is inside the vagina So possibly you know a little more arousing than it looks And I also said to her Now these sows I mean you may have noticed there The sow doesnt look to be in the throes of ecstasy And she said you cant make that conclusion because animals dont register pain or pleasure on their faces in the same way that we do Pigs for example are more like dogs They use the upper half of the face the ears are very expressive So youre not really sure whats going on with the pig Primates on the other hand we use our mouths more This is the ejaculation face of the stumptailed macaque And interestingly this has been observed in female macaques but only when mounting another female footnote footnote Masters and Johnson In the 1950s they decided okay were going to figure out the entire human sexual response cycle from arousal all the way through orgasm in men and women  everything that happens in the human body Okay with women a lot of this is happening inside This did not stop Masters and Johnson They developed an artificial coition machine This is basically a penis camera on a motor There is a phallus clear acrylic phallus with a camera and a light source attached to a motor that is kind of going like this And the woman would have sex with it That is what they would do Pretty amazing Sadly this device has been dismantled This just kills me not because I wanted to use it  I wanted to see it One fine day Alfred Kinsey decided to calculate the average distance traveled by ejaculated semen This was not idle curiosity Doctor Kinsey had heard  and there was a theory going around at the time this being the 1940s  that the force with which semen is thrown against the cervix was a factor in fertility Kinsey thought it was bunk so he got to work He got together in his lab 300 men a measuring tape and a movie camera And in fact he found that in three quarters of the men the stuff just kind of slopped out It wasnt spurted or thrown or ejected under great force However the record holder landed just shy of the eightfoot mark which is impressive Yes Exactly Sadly hes anonymous His name is not mentioned In his writeup of this experiment in his book Kinsey wrote Two sheets were laid down to protect the oriental carpets Which is my second favorite line in the entire oeuvre of Alfred Kinsey My favorite being Cheese crumbs spread before a pair of copulating rats will distract the female but not the male Thank you very much ThanksI have a confession to make But first I want you to make a little confession to me In the past year I want you to just raise your hand if youve experienced relatively little stress Anyone How about a moderate amount of stress Who has experienced a lot of stress Yeah Me too But that is not my confession My confession is this I am a health psychologist and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier But I fear that something Ive been teaching for the last 10 years is doing more harm than good and it has to do with stress For years Ive been telling people stress makes you sick It increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease Basically Ive turned stress into the enemy But I have changed my mind about stress and today I want to change yours Let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress This study tracked 30000 adults in the United States for eight years and they started by asking people How much stress have you experienced in the last year They also asked Do you believe that stress is harmful for your health And then they used public death records to find out who died Okay Some bad news first People who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a 43 percent increased risk of dying But that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health footnote footnote People who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die In fact they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study including people who had relatively little stress Now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths 182000 Americans died prematurely not from stress but from the belief that stress is bad for you That is over 20000 deaths a year Now if that estimate is correct that would make believing stress is bad for you the 15th largest cause of death in the United States last year killing more people than skin cancer HIVAIDS and homicide You can see why this study freaked me out Here Ive been spending so much energy telling people stress is bad for your health So this study got me wondering Can changing how you think about stress make you healthier And here the science says yes When you change your mind about stress you can change your bodys response to stress Now to explain how this works I want you all to pretend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out Its called the social stress test You come into the laboratory and youre told you have to give a fiveminute impromptu speech on your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you and to make sure you feel the pressure there are bright lights and a camera in your face kind of like this And the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging nonverbal feedback like this Now that youre sufficiently demoralized time for part two a math test And unbeknownst to you the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it Now were going to all do this together Its going to be fun For me Okay I want you all to count backwards from 996 in increments of seven Youre going to do this out loud as fast as you can starting with 996 Go Go faster Faster please Youre going too slow Stop Stop stop stop That guy made a mistake We are going to have to start all over again Youre not very good at this are you Okay so you get the idea If you were actually in this study youd probably be a little stressed out Your heart might be pounding you might be breathing faster maybe breaking out into a sweat And normally we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we arent coping very well with the pressure But what if you viewed them instead as signs that your body was energized was preparing you to meet this challenge Now that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted at Harvard University Before they went through the social stress test they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful That pounding heart is preparing you for action If youre breathing faster its no problem Its getting more oxygen to your brain And participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance well they were less stressed out less anxious more confident but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed footnote footnote Now in a typical stress response your heart rate goes up and your blood vessels constrict like this And this is one of the reasons that chronic stress is sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease Its not really healthy to be in this state all the time But in the study when participants viewed their stress response as helpful their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this Their heart was still pounding but this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile It actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage Over a lifetime of stressful experiences this one biological change could be the difference between a stressinduced heart attack at age 50 and living well into your 90s And this is really what the new science of stress reveals that how you think about stress matters So my goal as a health psychologist has changed I no longer want to get rid of your stress I want to make you better at stress And we just did a little intervention If you raised your hand and said youd had a lot of stress in the last year we could have saved your life because hopefully the next time your heart is pounding from stress youre going to remember this talk and youre going to think to yourself this is my body helping me rise to this challenge And when you view stress in that way your body believes you and your stress response becomes healthier Now I said I have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from so we are going to do one more intervention I want to tell you about one of the most underappreciated aspects of the stress response and the idea is this Stress makes you social To understand this side of stress we need to talk about a hormone oxytocin and I know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get It even has its own cute nickname the cuddle hormone because its released when you hug someone But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in Oxytocin is a neurohormone It finetunes your brains social instincts It primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family It enhances your empathy It even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about Some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin to become more compassionate and caring But heres what most people dont understand about oxytocin Its a stress hormone Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response Its as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound And when oxytocin is released in the stress response it is motivating you to seek support Your biological stress response is nudging you to tell someone how you feel instead of bottling it up Your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling so that you can support each other When life is difficult your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you Okay so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier Well oxytocin doesnt only act on your brain It also acts on your body and one of its main roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress Its a natural antiinflammatory It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress But my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart Your heart has receptors for this hormone and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate and heal from any stressinduced damage This stress hormone strengthens your heart And the cool thing is that all of these physical benefits of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support So when you reach out to others under stress either to seek support or to help someone else you release more of this hormone your stress response becomes healthier and you actually recover faster from stress I find this amazing that your stress response has a builtin mechanism for stress resilience and that mechanism is human connection footnote footnote I want to finish by telling you about one more study And listen up because this study could also save a life This study tracked about 1000 adults in the United States and they ranged in age from 34 to 93 and they started the study by asking How much stress have you experienced in the last year They also asked How much time have you spent helping out friends neighbors people in your community And then they used public records for the next five years to find out who died Okay so the bad news first For every major stressful life experience like financial difficulties or family crisis that increased the risk of dying by 30 percent But  and I hope you are expecting a but by now  but that wasnt true for everyone People who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stressrelated increase in dying Zero Caring created resilience And so we see once again that the harmful effects of stress on your health are not inevitable How you think and how you act can transform your experience of stress When you choose to view your stress response as helpful you create the biology of courage And when you choose to connect with others under stress you can create resilience Now I wouldnt necessarily ask for more stressful experiences in my life but this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress Stress gives us access to our hearts The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connecting with others and yes your pounding physical heart working so hard to give you strength and energy And when you choose to view stress in this way youre not just getting better at stress youre actually making a pretty profound statement Youre saying that you can trust yourself to handle lifes challenges And youre remembering that you dont have to face them alone Thank you Chris Anderson This is kind of amazing what youre telling us It seems amazing to me that a belief about stress can make so much difference to someones life expectancy How would that extend to advice like if someone is making a lifestyle choice between say a stressful job and a nonstressful job does it matter which way they go Its equally wise to go for the stressful job so long as you believe that you can handle it in some sense KM Yeah and one thing we know for certain is that chasing meaning is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort And so I would say thats really the best way to make decisions is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows CA Thank you so much Kelly Its pretty coolI have a confession to make

stress that follows CA Thank you so much Kelly Its pretty coolWhen I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old we were playing on top of a bunk bed I was two years older than my sister at the time  I mean Im two years older than her now  but at the time it meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do and I wanted to play war So we were up on top of our bunk beds And on one side of the bunk bed I had put out all of my GI Joe soldiers and weaponry And on the other side were all my sisters My Little Ponies ready for a cavalry charge There are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon but since my sister is not here with us today let me tell you the true story  which is my sisters a little on the clumsy side Somehow without any help or push from her older brother at all Amy disappeared off of the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor I nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and I played as safely and as quietly as possible And seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amys arm just one week before  heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet for which I have yet to be thanked I was trying as hard as I could  she didnt even see it coming  I was trying hard to be on my best behavior And I saw my sisters face this wail of pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and wake my parents from the long winters nap for which they had settled So I did the only thing my frantic seven yearold brain could think to do to avert this tragedy And if you have children youve seen this hundreds of times I said Amy wait Dont cry Did you see how you landed No human lands on all fours like that Amy I think this means youre a unicorn Now that was cheating because there was nothing she would want more than not to be Amy the hurt five yearold little sister but Amy the special unicorn Of course this option was open to her brain at no point in the past And you could see how my poor manipulated sister faced conflict as her little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced or contemplating her newfound identity as a unicorn And the latter won Instead of crying or ceasing our play instead of waking my parents with all the negative consequences for me a smile spread across her face and she scrambled back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn  with one broken leg What we stumbled across at this tender age of just five and seven  we had no idea at the time  was was going be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain We had stumbled across something called positive psychology which is the reason Im here today and the reason that I wake up every morning When I started talking about this research outside of academia with companies and schools the first thing they said to never do is to start with a graph The first thing I want to do is start with a graph This graph looks boring but it is the reason I get excited and wake up every morning And this graph doesnt even mean anything its fake data What we found is  If I got this data studying you I would be thrilled because theres a trend there and that means that I can get published which is all that really matters There is one weird red dot above the curve theres one weirdo in the room  I know who you are I saw you earlier  thats no problem Thats no problem as most of you know because I can just delete that dot I can delete that dot because thats clearly a measurement error And we know thats a measurement error because its messing up my data So one of the first things we teach people in economics statistics business and psychology courses is how in a statistically valid way do we eliminate the weirdos How do we eliminate the outliers so we can find the line of best fit Which is fantastic if Im trying to find out how many Advil the average person should be taking  two But if Im interested in your potential or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity were creating the cult of the average with science If I asked a question like How fast can a child learn how to read in a classroom scientists change the answer to How fast does the average child learn how to read in that classroom and we tailor the class towards the average If you fall below the average then psychologists get thrilled because that means youre depressed or have a disorder or hopefully both Were hoping for both because our business model is if you come into a therapy session with one problem we want to make sure you leave knowing you have ten so you keep coming back Well go back into your childhood if necessary but eventually we want to make you normal again But normal is merely average And positive psychology posits that if we study what is merely average we will remain merely average Then instead of deleting those positive outliers what I intentionally do is come into a population like this one and say why Why are some of you high above the curve in terms of intellectual athletic musical ability creativity energy levels resiliency in the face of challenge sense of humor Whatever it is instead of deleting you what I want to do is study you Because maybe we can glean information not just how to move people up to the average but move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide The reason this graph is important to me is on the news the majority of the information is not positive in fact its negative Most of its about murder corruption diseases natural disasters And very quickly my brain starts to think thats the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world This creates the medical school syndrome During the first year of medical training as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases suddenly you realize you have all of them I have a brother inlaw named Bobo which is a whole other story Bobo married Amy the unicorn Bobo called me on the phone  from Yale Medical School and Bobo said Shawn I have leprosy Which even at Yale is extraordinarily rare But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause Were finding its not necessarily the reality that shapes us but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality And if we can change the lens not only can we change your happiness we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time I applied to Harvard on a dare I didnt expect to get in and my family had no money for college When I got a military scholarship two weeks later they let me go Something that wasnt even a possibility became a reality I assumed everyone there would see it as a privilege as well that theyd be excited to be there Even in a classroom full of people smarter than you I felt youd be happy just to be in that classroom But what I found is while some people experience that when I graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students  Harvard asked me to I wasnt that guy I was an officer to counsel students through the difficult four years And in my research and my teaching I found that these students no matter how happy they were with their original success of getting into the school two weeks later their brains were focused not on the privilege of being there nor on their philosophy or physics but on the competition the workload the hassles stresses complaints When I first went in there I walked into the freshmen dining hall which is where my friends from Waco Texas which is where I grew up  I know some of you know this When theyd visit theyd look around and say This dining hall looks like something out of Hogwarts It does because that was Hogwarts and thats Harvard And when they see this they say Why do you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard What does a Harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about Embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness Because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels when in reality if I know everything about your external world I can only predict 10 of your longterm happiness 90 percent of your longterm happiness is predicted not by the external world but by the way your brain processes the world And if we change it if we change our formula for happiness and success we can change the way that we can then affect reality What we found is that only 25 of job successes are predicted by IQ 75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat I talked to a New England boarding school probably the most prestigious one and they said We already know that So every year instead of just teaching our students we have a wellness week And were so excited Monday night we have the worlds leading expert will speak about adolescent depression Tuesday night its school violence and bullying Wednesday night is eating disorders Thursday night is illicit drug use And Friday night were trying to decide between risky sex or happiness I said Thats most peoples Friday nights Which Im glad you liked but they did not like that at all Silence on the phone And into the silence I said Id be happy to speak at your school but thats not a wellness week thats a sickness week Youve outlined all the negative things that can happen but not talked about the positive The absence of disease is not health Heres how we get to health We need to reverse the formula for happiness and success In the last three years Ive traveled to 45 countries working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn And I found that most companies and schools follow a formula for success which is this If I work harder Ill be more successful And if Im more successful then Ill be happier That undergirds most of our parenting and managing styles the way that we motivate our behavior And the problem is its scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons Every time your brain has a success you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like You got good grades now you have to get better grades you got into a good school and after you get into a better one you got a good job now you have to get a better job you hit your sales target were going to change it And if happiness is on the opposite side of success your brain never gets there Weve pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon as a society And thats because we think we have to be successful then well be happier But our brains work in the opposite order If you can raise somebodys level of positivity in the present then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage which is your brain at positive performs significantly better than at negative neutral or stressed Your intelligence rises your creativity rises your energy levels rise In fact weve found that every single business outcome improves Your brain at positive is 31 more productive than your brain at negative neutral or stressed Youre 37 better at sales Doctors are 19 percent faster more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative neutral or stressed Which means we can reverse the formula If we can find a way of becoming positive in the present then our brains work even more successfully as were able to work harder faster and more intelligently We need to be able to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of Because dopamine which floods into your system when youre positive has two functions Not only does it make you happier it turns on all of the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way Weve found there are ways that you can train your brain to be able to become more positive In just a twominute span of time done for 21 days in a row we can actually rewire your brain allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully Weve done these things in research now in every company that Ive worked with getting them to write down three new things that theyre grateful for for 21 days in a row three new things each day And at the end of that their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world not for the negative but for the positive first Journaling about one positive experience youve had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it Exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters We find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural ADHD that weve been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand And finally random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness We get people when they open up their inbox to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their support network And by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we train our bodies what weve found is we can reverse the formula for happiness and success and in doing so not only create ripples of positivity but a real revolution Thank you very muchWhen I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old we were playing on top of a bunk bed I was two years older than my sister at the time  I mean Im two

hundreds of times I said Amy wait Dont cry Did you see how you landed No human lands on all fours like that Amy I think this means youre a unicorn Now that was cheating because there was nothing she would want more than not to be Amy the hurt five yearold little sister but Amy the special unicorn Of course this option was open to her brain at no point in the past And you could see how my poor manipulated sister faced conflict as her little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced or contemplating her newfound identity as a unicorn And the latter won Instead of crying or ceasing our play instead of waking my parents with all the negative consequences for me a smile spread across her face and she scrambled back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn  with one broken leg What we stumbled across at this tender age of just five and seven  we had no idea at the time  was was going be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain We had stumbled across something called positive psychology which is the reason Im here today and the reason that I wake up every morning When I started talking about this research outside of academia with companies and schools the first thing they said to never do is to start with a graph The first thing I want to do is start with a graph This graph looks boring but it is the reason I get excited and wake up every morning And this graph doesnt even mean anything its fake data What we found is  If I got this data studying you I would be thrilled because theres a trend there and that means that I can get published which is all that really matters There is one weird red dot above the curve theres one weirdo in the room  I know who you are I saw you earlier  thats no problem Thats no problem as most of you know because I can just delete that dot I can delete that dot because thats clearly a measurement error And we know thats a measurement error because its messing up my data So one of the first things we teach people in economics statistics business and psychology courses is how in a statistically valid way do we eliminate the weirdos How do we eliminate the outliers so we can find the line of best fit Which is fantastic if Im trying to find out how many Advil the average person should be taking  two But if Im interested in your potential or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity were creating the cult of the average with science If I asked a question like How fast can a child learn how to read in a classroom scientists change the answer to How fast does the average child learn how to read in that classroom and we tailor the class towards the average If you fall below the average then psychologists get thrilled because that means youre depressed or have a disorder or hopefully both Were hoping for both because our business model is if you come into a therapy session with one problem we want to make sure you leave knowing you have ten so you keep coming back Well go back into your childhood if necessary but eventually we want to make you normal again But normal is merely average And positive psychology posits that if we study what is merely average we will remain merely average Then instead of deleting those positive outliers what I intentionally do is come into a population like this one and say why Why are some of you high above the curve in terms of intellectual athletic musical ability creativity energy levels resiliency in the face of challenge sense of humor Whatever it is instead of deleting you what I want to do is study you Because maybe we can glean information not just how to move people up to the average but move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide The reason this graph is important to me is on the news the majority of the information is not positive in fact its negative Most of its about murder corruption diseases natural disasters And very quickly my brain starts to think thats the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world This creates the medical school syndrome During the first year of medical training as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases suddenly you realize you have all of them I have a brother inlaw named Bobo which is a whole other story Bobo married Amy the unicorn Bobo called me on the phone  from Yale Medical School and Bobo said Shawn I have leprosy Which even at Yale is extraordinarily rare But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause Were finding its not necessarily the reality that shapes us but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality And if we can change the lens not only can we change your happiness we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time I applied to Harvard on a dare I didnt expect to get in and my family had no money for college When I got a military scholarship two weeks later they let me go Something that wasnt even a possibility became a reality I assumed everyone there would see it as a privilege as well that theyd be excited to be there Even in a classroom full of people smarter than you I felt youd be happy just to be in that classroom But what I found is while some people experience that when I graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students  Harvard asked me to I wasnt that guy I was an officer to counsel students through the difficult four years And in my research and my teaching I found that these students no matter how happy they were with their original success of getting into the school two weeks later their brains were focused not on the privilege of being there nor on their philosophy or physics but on the competition the workload the hassles stresses complaints When I first went in there I walked into the freshmen dining hall which is where my friends from Waco Texas which is where I grew up  I know some of you know this When theyd visit theyd look around and say This dining hall looks like something out of Hogwarts It does because that was Hogwarts and thats Harvard And when they see this they say Why do you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard What does a Harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about Embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness Because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels when in reality if I know everything about your external world I can only predict 10 of your longterm happiness 90 percent of your longterm happiness is predicted not by the external world but by the way your brain processes the world And if we change it if we change our formula for happiness and success we can change the way that we can then affect reality What we found is that only 25 of job successes are predicted by IQ 75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat I talked to a New England boarding school probably the most prestigious one and they said We already know that So every year instead of just teaching our students we have a wellness week And were so excited Monday night we have the worlds leading expert will speak about adolescent depression Tuesday night its school violence and bullying Wednesday night is eating disorders Thursday night is illicit drug use And Friday night were trying to decide between risky sex or happiness I said Thats most peoples Friday nights Which Im glad you liked but they did not like that at all Silence on the phone And into the silence I said Id be happy to speak at your school but thats not a wellness week thats a sickness week Youve outlined all the negative things that can happen but not talked about the positive The absence of disease is not health Heres how we get to health We need to reverse the formula for happiness and success In the last three years Ive traveled to 45 countries working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn And I found that most companies and schools follow a formula for success which is this If I work harder Ill be more successful And if Im more successful then Ill be happier That undergirds most of our parenting and managing styles the way that we motivate our behavior And the problem is its scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons Every time your brain has a success you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like You got good grades now you have to get better grades you got into a good school and after you get into a better one you got a good job now you have to get a better job you hit your sales target were going to change it And if happiness is on the opposite side of success your brain never gets there Weve pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon as a society And thats because we think we have to be successful then well be happier But our brains work in the opposite order If you can raise somebodys level of positivity in the present then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage which is your brain at positive performs significantly better than at negative neutral or stressed Your intelligence rises your creativity rises your energy levels rise In fact weve found that every single business outcome improves Your brain at positive is 31 more productive than your brain at negative neutral or stressed Youre 37 better at sales Doctors are 19 percent faster more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative neutral or stressed Which means we can reverse the formula If we can find a way of becoming positive in the present then our brains work even more successfully as were able to work harder faster and more intelligently We need to be able to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of Because dopamine which floods into your system when youre positive has two functions Not only does it make you happier it turns on all of the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way Weve found there are ways that you can train your brain to be able to become more positive In just a twominute span of time done for 21 days in a row we can actually rewire your brain allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully Weve done these things in research now in every company that Ive worked with getting them to write down three new things that theyre grateful for for 21 days in a row three new things each day And at the end of that their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world not for the negative but for the positive first Journaling about one positive experience youve had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it Exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters We find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural ADHD that weve been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand And finally random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness We get people when they open up their inbox to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their support network And by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we train our bodies what weve found is we can reverse the formula for happiness and success and in doing so not only create ripples of positivity but a real revolution Thank you very muchA few years ago I broke into my own house I had just driven home it was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter I had been visiting my friend Jeff across town and the thermometer on the front porch read minus 40 degrees  and dont bother asking if thats Celsius or Fahrenheit minus 40 is where the two scales meet  it was very cold And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets I found I didnt have my keys In fact I could see them through the window lying on the dining room table where I had left them So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows and they were locked tight I thought about calling a locksmith  at least I had my cellphone but at midnight it could take a while for a locksmith to show up and it was cold I couldnt go back to my friend Jeffs house for the night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning and I needed to get my passport and my suitcase So desperate and freezing cold I found a large rock and I broke through the basement window cleared out the shards of glass I crawled through I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening figuring that in the morning on the way to the airport I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it This was going to be expensive but probably no more expensive than a middleofthenight locksmith so I figured under the circumstances I was coming out even Now Im a neuroscientist by training and I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate it modulates adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking So the next morning when I woke up on too little sleep worrying about the hole in the window and a mental note that I had to call my contractor and the freezing temperatures and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe and you know with all the cortisol in my brain my thinking was cloudy but I didnt know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy And it wasnt until I got to the airport checkin counter that I realized I didnt have my passport So I raced home in the snow and ice 40 minutes got my passport raced back to the airport I made it just in time but they had given away my seat to someone else so I got stuck in the back of the plane next to the bathrooms in a seat that wouldnt recline on an eighthour flight Well I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep And I started wondering are there things that I can do systems that I can put into place that will prevent bad things from happening Or at least if bad things happen will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe So I started thinking about that but my thoughts didnt crystallize until about a month later I was having dinner with my colleague Danny Kahneman the Nobel Prize winner and I somewhat embarrassedly told him about having broken my window and you know forgotten my passport and Danny shared with me that hed been practicing something called prospective hindsight Its something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein who had written about it a few years before also called the premortem Now you all know what the postmortem is Whenever theres a disaster a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong right Well in the premortem Danny explained you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening or to minimize the damage So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a premortem Some of them are obvious some of them are not so obvious Ill start with the obvious ones Around the home designate a place for things that are easily lost Now this sounds like common sense and it is but theres a lot of science to back this up based on the way our spatial memory works Theres a structure in the brain called the hippocampus that evolved over tens of thousands of years to keep track of the locations of important things  where the well is where fish can be found that stand of fruit trees where the friendly and enemy tribes live The hippocampus is the part of the brain that in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged Its the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts And if youre wondering somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels and they could still find their nuts They werent using smell they were using the hippocampus this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things But its really good for things that dont move around much not so good for things that move around So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports So in the home designate a spot for your keys  a hook by the door maybe a decorative bowl For your passport a particular drawer For your reading glasses a particular table If you designate a spot and youre scrupulous about it your things will always be there when you look for them What about travel Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards your drivers license your passport mail it to yourself so its in the cloud If these things are lost or stolen you can facilitate replacement Now these are some rather obvious things Remember when youre under stress the brain releases cortisol Cortisol is toxic and it causes cloudy thinking So part of the practice of the premortem is to recognize that under stress youre not going to be at your best and you should put systems in place And theres perhaps no more stressful a situation than when youre confronted with a medical decision to make And at some point all of us are going to be in that position where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one to help them with a decision And so I want to talk about that And Im going to talk about a very particular medical condition But this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decisionmaking and indeed for financial decisionmaking and social decisionmaking  any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says I just got your lab work back your cholesterols a little high Now you all know that high cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease heart attack stroke And so youre thinking having high cholesterol isnt the best thing and so the doctor says You know Id like to give you a drug that will help you lower your cholesterol a statin And youve probably heard of statins you know that theyre among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world today you probably even know people who take them And so youre thinking Yeah Give me the statin But theres a question you should ask at this point a statistic you should ask for that most doctors dont like talking about and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less Its for the number needed to treat Now what is this the NNT Its the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is helped And youre thinking what kind of crazy statistic is that The number should be one My doctor wouldnt prescribe something to me if its not going to help But actually medical practice doesnt work that way And its not the doctors fault if its anybodys fault its the fault of scientists like me We havent figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough But GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin what do you suppose it is How many people have to take it before one person is helped 300 This is according to research by research practitioners Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband independently confirmed by Bloombergcom I ran through the numbers myself 300 people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack stroke or other adverse event is prevented Now youre probably thinking Well OK one in 300 chance of lowering my cholesterol Why not doc Give me the prescription anyway But you should ask at this point for another statistic and that is Tell me about the side effects Right So for this particular drug the side effects occur in five percent of the patients And they include terrible things  debilitating muscle and joint pain gastrointestinal distress  but now youre thinking Five percent not very likely its going to happen to me Ill still take the drug But wait a minute Remember under stress youre not thinking clearly So think about how youre going to work through this ahead of time so you dont have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot 300 people take the drug right One persons helped five percent of those 300 have side effects thats 15 people Youre 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug Now Im not saying whether you should take the statin or not Im just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor Medical ethics requires it its part of the principle of informed consent You have the right to have access to this kind of information to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not Now you might be thinking Ive pulled this number out of the air for shock value but in fact its rather typical this number needed to treat For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50 removal of the prostate for cancer the number needed to treat is 49 Thats right 49 surgeries are done for every one person whos helped And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients They include impotence erectile dysfunction urinary incontinence rectal tearing fecal incontinence And if youre lucky and youre one of the 50 percent who has these theyll only last for a year or two So the idea of the premortem is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward You dont want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot And you also want to think about things like quality of life Because you have a choice oftentimes do you I want a shorter life thats painfree or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end These are things to talk about and think about now with your family and your loved ones You might change your mind in the heat of the moment but at least youre practiced with this kind of thinking Remember our brain under stress releases cortisol and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down Theres an evolutionary reason for this Facetoface with a predator you dont need your digestive system or your libido or your immune system because if youre body is expending metabolism on those things and you dont react quickly you might become the lions lunch and then none of those things matter Unfortunately one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational logical thinking as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown So we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed We all are going to fail now and then The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place Getting back to that snowy night in Montreal when I got back from my trip I had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door with a key to the front door in it an easy to remember combination And I have to admit I still have piles of mail that havent been sorted and piles of emails that I havent gone through So Im not completely organized but I see organization as a gradual process and Im getting there Thank you very muchSo Ill be speaking to you using language  because I can This is one these magical abilities that we humans have We can transmit really complicated thoughts to one another So what Im doing right now is Im making sounds with my mouth as Im exhaling Im making tones and hisses and puffs and those are creating air vibrations in the air Those air vibrations are traveling to you theyre hitting your eardrums and then your brain takes those vibrations from your eardrums and transforms them into thoughts I hope I hope thats happening So because of this ability we humans are able to transmit our ideas across vast reaches of space and time Were able to transmit knowledge across minds I can put a bizarre new idea in your mind right now I could say Imagine a jellyfish waltzing in a library while thinking about quantum mechanics Now if everything has gone relatively well in your life so far you probably havent had that thought before But now Ive just made you think it through language Now of course there isnt just one language in the world there are about 7000 languages spoken around the world And all the languages differ from one another in all kinds of ways Some languages have different sounds they have different vocabularies and they also have different structures  very importantly different structures That begs the question Does the language we speak shape the way we think Now this is an ancient question People have been speculating about this question forever Charlemagne Holy Roman emperor said To have a second language is to have a second soul  strong statement that language crafts reality But on the other hand Shakespeare has Juliet say Whats in a name A rose by any other name would smell as sweet Well that suggests that maybe language doesnt craft reality These arguments have gone back and forth for thousands of years But until recently there hasnt been any data to help us decide either way Recently in my lab and other labs around the world weve started doing research and now we have actual scientific data to weigh in on this question So let me tell you about some of my favorite examples Ill start with an example from an Aboriginal community in Australia that I had the chance to work with These are the Kuuk Thaayorre people They live in Pormpuraaw at the very west edge of Cape York Whats cool about Kuuk Thaayorre is in Kuuk Thaayorre they dont use words like left and right and instead everything is in cardinal directions north south east and west And when I say everything I really mean everything You would say something like Oh theres an ant on your southwest leg Or Move your cup to the northnortheast a little bit In fact the way that you say hello in Kuuk Thaayorre is you say Which way are you going And the answer should be Northnortheast in the far distance How about you So imagine as youre walking around your day every person you greet you have to report your heading direction But that would actually get you oriented pretty fast right Because you literally couldnt get past hello if you didnt know which way you were going In fact people who speak languages like this stay oriented really well They stay oriented better than we used to think humans could We used to think that humans were worse than other creatures because of some biological excuse Oh we dont have magnets in our beaks or in our scales No if your language and your culture trains you to do it actually you can do it There are humans around the world who stay oriented really well And just to get us in agreement about how different this is from the way we do it I want you all to close your eyes for a second and point southeast Keep your eyes closed Point OK so you can open your eyes I see you guys pointing there there there there there  I dont know which way it is myself  You have not been a lot of help So lets just say the accuracy in this room was not very high This is a big difference in cognitive ability across languages right Where one group  very distinguished group like you guys  doesnt know which way is which but in another group I could ask a fiveyearold and they would know There are also really big differences in how people think about time So here I have pictures of my grandfather at different ages And if I ask an English speaker to organize time they might lay it out this way from left to right This has to do with writing direction If you were a speaker of Hebrew or Arabic you might do it going in the opposite direction from right to left But how would the Kuuk Thaayorre this Aboriginal group I just told you about do it They dont use words like left and right Let me give you hint When we sat people facing south they organized time from left to right When we sat them facing north they organized time from right to left When we sat them facing east time came towards the body Whats the pattern East to west right So for them time doesnt actually get locked on the body at all it gets locked on the landscape So for me if Im facing this way then time goes this way and if Im facing this way then time goes this way Im facing this way time goes this way  very egocentric of me to have the direction of time chase me around every time I turn my body For the Kuuk Thaayorre time is locked on the landscape Its a dramatically different way of thinking about time Heres another really smart human trick Suppose I ask you how many penguins are there Well I bet I know how youd solve that problem if you solved it You went One two three four five six seven eight You counted them You named each one with a number and the last number you said was the number of penguins This is a little trick that youre taught to use as kids You learn the number list and you learn how to apply it A little linguistic trick Well some languages dont do this because some languages dont have exact number words Theyre languages that dont have a word like seven or a word like eight In fact people who speak these languages dont count and they have trouble keeping track of exact quantities So for example if I ask you to match this number of penguins to the same number of ducks you would be able to do that by counting But folks who dont have that linguistic trick cant do that Languages also differ in how they divide up the color spectrum  the visual world Some languages have lots of words for colors some have only a couple words light and dark And languages differ in where they put boundaries between colors So for example in English theres a word for blue that covers all of the colors that you can see on the screen but in Russian there isnt a single word Instead Russian speakers have to differentiate between light blue goluboy and dark blue siniy So Russians have this lifetime of experience of in language distinguishing these two colors When we test peoples ability to perceptually discriminate these colors what we find is that Russian speakers are faster across this linguistic boundary Theyre faster to be able to tell the difference between a light and dark blue And when you look at peoples brains as theyre looking at colors  say you have colors shifting slowly from light to dark blue  the brains of people who use different words for light and dark blue will give a surprised reaction as the colors shift from light to dark as if Ooh something has categorically changed whereas the brains of English speakers for example that dont make this categorical distinction dont give that surprise because nothing is categorically changing Languages have all kinds of structural quirks This is one of my favorites Lots of languages have grammatical gender every noun gets assigned a gender often masculine or feminine And these genders differ across languages So for example the sun is feminine in German but masculine in Spanish and the moon the reverse Could this actually have any consequence for how people think Do German speakers think of the sun as somehow more femalelike and the moon somehow more malelike Actually it turns out thats the case So if you ask German and Spanish speakers to say describe a bridge like the one here  bridge happens to be grammatically feminine in German grammatically masculine in Spanish  German speakers are more likely to say bridges are beautiful elegant and stereotypically feminine words Whereas Spanish speakers will be more likely to say theyre strong or long these masculine words Languages also differ in how they describe events right You take an event like this an accident In English its fine to say He broke the vase In a language like Spanish you might be more likely to say The vase broke or The vase broke itself If its an accident you wouldnt say that someone did it In English quite weirdly we can even say things like I broke my arm Now in lots of languages you couldnt use that construction unless you are a lunatic and you went out looking to break your arm  and you succeeded If it was an accident you would use a different construction Now this has consequences So people who speak different languages will pay attention to different things depending on what their language usually requires them to do So we show the same accident to English speakers and Spanish speakers English speakers will remember who did it because English requires you to say He did it he broke the vase Whereas Spanish speakers might be less likely to remember who did it if its an accident but theyre more likely to remember that it was an accident Theyre more likely to remember the intention So two people watch the same event witness the same crime but end up remembering different things about that event This has implications of course for eyewitness testimony It also has implications for blame and punishment So if you take English speakers and I just show you someone breaking a vase and I say He broke the vase as opposed to The vase broke even though you can witness it yourself you can watch the video you can watch the crime against the vase you will punish someone more you will blame someone more if I just said He broke it as opposed to It broke The language guides our reasoning about events Now Ive given you a few examples of how language can profoundly shape the way we think and it does so in a variety of ways So language can have big effects like we saw with space and time where people can lay out space and time in completely different coordinate frames from each other Language can also have really deep effects  thats what we saw with the case of number Having count words in your language having number words opens up the whole world of mathematics Of course if you dont count you cant do algebra you cant do any of the things that would be required to build a room like this or make this broadcast right This little trick of number words gives you a stepping stone into a whole cognitive realm Language can also have really early effects what we saw in the case of color These are really simple basic perceptual decisions We make thousands of them all the time and yet language is getting in there and fussing even with these tiny little perceptual decisions that we make Language can have really broad effects So the case of grammatical gender may be a little silly but at the same time grammatical gender applies to all nouns That means language can shape how youre thinking about anything that can be named by a noun Thats a lot of stuff And finally I gave you an example of how language can shape things that have personal weight to us  ideas like blame and punishment or eyewitness memory These are important things in our daily lives Now the beauty of linguistic diversity is that it reveals to us just how ingenious and how flexible the human mind is Human minds have invented not one cognitive universe but 7000  there are 7000 languages spoken around the world And we can create many more  languages of course are living things things that we can hone and change to suit our needs The tragic thing is that were losing so much of this linguistic diversity all the time Were losing about one language a week and by some estimates half of the worlds languages will be gone in the next hundred years And the even worse news is that right now almost everything we know about the human mind and human brain is based on studies of usually American Englishspeaking undergraduates at universities That excludes almost all humans Right So what we know about the human mind is actually incredibly narrow and biased and our science has to do better I want to leave you with this final thought Ive told you about how speakers of different languages think differently but of course thats not about how people elsewhere think Its about how you think Its how the language that you speak shapes the way that you think And that gives you the opportunity to ask Why do I think the way that I do How could I think differently And also What thoughts do I wish to create Thank you very much Footnotes top top Note So let me tell you about some of my favorite

his company He said Im working with three friends and were going to try to disrupt an industry by selling stuff online And I said OK you guys spent the whole summer on this right No we all took internships just in case it doesnt work out All right but youre going to go in full time once you graduate Not exactly Weve all lined up backup jobs Six months go by its the day before the company launches and there is still not a functioning website You guys realize the entire company is a website Thats literally all it is So I obviously declined to invest And they ended up naming the company Warby Parker They sell glasses online They were recently recognized as the worlds most innovative company and valued at over a billion dollars And now My wife handles our investments Why was I so wrong To find out Ive been studying people that I come to call originals Originals are nonconformists people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them They are people who stand out and speak up Originals drive creativity and change in the world Theyre the people you want to bet on And they look nothing like I expected I want to show you today three things Ive learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them So the first reason that I passed on Warby Parker was they were really slow getting off the ground Now you are all intimately familiar with the mind of a procrastinator Well I have a confession for you Im the opposite Im a precrastinator Yes thats an actual term You know that panic you feel a few hours before a big deadline when you havent done anything yet I just feel that a few months ahead of time So this started early when I was a kid I took Nintendo games very seriously I would wake up at 5am start playing and not stop until I had mastered them Eventually it got so out of hand that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side of Nintendo starring me Since then I have traded hair for teeth But this served me well in college because I finished my senior thesis four months before the deadline And I was proud of that until a few years ago I had a student named Jihae who came to me and said I have my most creative ideas when Im procrastinating And I was like Thats cute where are the four papers you owe me No she was one of our most creative students and as an organizational psychologist this is the kind of idea that I test So I challenged her to get some data She goes into a bunch of companies She has people fill out surveys about how often they procrastinate Then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are And sure enough the precrastinators like me who rush in and do everything early are rated as less creative than people who procrastinate moderately So I want to know what happens to the chronic procrastinators She was like I dont know They didnt fill out my survey No here are our results You actually do see that the people who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off that they dont have any new ideas And on the flip side the people who race in are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they dont have original thoughts either Theres a sweet spot where originals seem to live Why is this Maybe original people just have bad work habits Maybe procrastinating does not cause creativity footnote footnote To find out we designed some experiments We asked people to generate new business ideas and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative and useful they are And some of them are asked to do the task right away Others we randomly assign to procrastinate by dangling Minesweeper in front of them for either five or 10 minutes And sure enough the moderate procrastinators are 16 percent more creative than the other two groups Now Minesweeper is awesome but its not the driver of the effect because if you play the game first before you learn about the task theres no creativity boost Its only when youre told that youre going to be working on this problem and then you start procrastinating but the task is still active in the back of your mind that you start to incubate Procrastination gives you time to consider divergent ideas to think in nonlinear ways to make unexpected leaps So just as we were finishing these experiments I was starting to write a book about originals and I thought This is the perfect time to teach myself to procrastinate while writing a chapter on procrastination So I metaprocrastinated and like any selfrespecting precrastinator I woke up early the next morning and I made a todo list with steps on how to procrastinate footnote footnote And then I worked diligently toward my goal of not making progress toward my goal I started writing the procrastination chapter and one day  I was halfway through  I literally put it away in midsentence for months It was agony But when I came back to it I had all sorts of new ideas As Aaron Sorkin put it You call it procrastinating I call it thinking And along the way I discovered that a lot of great originals in history were procrastinators Take Leonardo da Vinci He toiled on and off for 16 years on the Mona Lisa He felt like a failure He wrote as much in his journal But some of the diversions he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light and made him into a much better painter What about Martin Luther King Jr The night before the biggest speech of his life the March on Washington he was up past 3am rewriting it Hes sitting in the audience waiting for his turn to go onstage and he is still scribbling notes and crossing out lines When he gets onstage 11 minutes in he leaves his prepared remarks to utter four words that changed the course of history I have a dream That was not in the script By delaying the task of finalizing the speech until the very last minute he left himself open to the widest range of possible ideas And because the text wasnt set in stone he had freedom to improvise footnote footnote Procrastinating is a vice when it comes to productivity but it can be a virtue for creativity What you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start but theyre slow to finish And this is what I missed with Warby Parker When they were dragging their heels for six months I looked at them and said You know a lot of other companies are starting to sell glasses online They missed the firstmover advantage But what I didnt realize was they were spending all that time trying to figure out how to get people to be comfortable ordering glasses online And it turns out the firstmover advantage is mostly a myth Look at a classic study of over 50 product categories comparing the first movers who created the market with the improvers who introduced something different and better What you see is that the first movers had a failure rate of 47 percent compared with only 8 percent for the improvers Look at Facebook waiting to build a social network until after Myspace and Friendster Look at Google waiting for years after Altavista and Yahoo Its much easier to improve on somebody elses idea than it is to create something new from scratch So the lesson I learned is that to be original you dont have to be first You just have to be different and better But that wasnt the only reason I passed on Warby Parker They were also full of doubts They had backup plans lined up and that made me doubt that they had the courage to be original because I expected that originals would look something like this Now on the surface a lot of original people look confident but behind the scenes they feel the same fear and doubt that the rest of us do They just manage it differently Let me show you this is a depiction of how the creative process works for most of us Now in my research I discovered there are two different kinds of doubt Theres selfdoubt and idea doubt Selfdoubt is paralyzing It leads you to freeze But idea doubt is energizing It motivates you to test to experiment to refine just like MLK did And so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap from step three to step four Instead of saying Im crap you say The first few drafts are always crap and Im just not there yet So how do you get there Well theres a clue it turns out in the Internet browser that you use We can predict your job performance and your commitment just by knowing what web browser you use Now some of you are not going to like the results of this study  But there is good evidence that Firefox and Chrome users significantly outperform Internet Explorer and Safari users Yes footnote footnote They also stay in their jobs 15 percent longer by the way Why Its not a technical advantage The four browser groups on average have similar typing speed and they also have similar levels of computer knowledge Its about how you got the browser Because if you use Internet Explorer or Safari those came preinstalled on your computer and you accepted the default option that was handed to you If you wanted Firefox or Chrome you had to doubt the default and ask is there a different option out there and then be a little resourceful and download a new browser So people hear about this study and theyre like Great if I want to get better at my job I just need to upgrade my browser No its about being the kind of person who takes the initiative to doubt the default and look for a better option And if you do that well you will open yourself up to the opposite of déjà vu Theres a name for it Its called vuja de footnote footnote Vuja de is when you look at something youve seen many times before and all of a sudden see it with fresh eyes Its a screenwriter who looks at a movie script that cant get the green light for more than half a century In every past version the main character has been an evil queen But Jennifer Lee starts to question whether that makes sense She rewrites the first act reinvents the villain as a tortured hero and Frozen becomes the most successful animated movie ever So theres a simple message from this story When you feel doubt dont let it go What about fear Originals feel fear too Theyre afraid of failing but what sets them apart from the rest of us is that theyre even more afraid of failing to try They know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all They know that in the long run our biggest regrets are not our actions but our inactions The things we wish we could redo if you look at the science are the chances not taken footnote footnote Elon Musk told me recently he didnt expect Tesla to succeed He was sure the first few SpaceX launches would fail to make it to orbit let alone get back but it was too important not to try And for so many of us when we have an important idea we dont bother to try But I have some good news for you You are not going to get judged on your bad ideas A lot of people think they will If you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea their most important suggestion 85 percent of them stayed silent instead of speaking up They were afraid of embarrassing themselves of looking stupid But guess what Originals have lots and lots of bad ideas tons of them in fact Take the guy who invented this Do you care that he came up with a talking doll so creepy that it scared not only kids but adults too No You celebrate Thomas Edison for pioneering the light bulb footnote footnote If you look across fields the greatest originals are the ones who fail the most because theyre the ones who try the most Take classical composers the best of the best Why do some of them get more pages in encyclopedias than others and also have their compositions rerecorded more times One of the best predictors is the sheer volume of compositions that they generate The more output you churn out the more variety you get and the better your chances of stumbling on something truly original Even the three icons of classical music  Bach Beethoven Mozart  had to generate hundreds and hundreds of compositions to come up with a much smaller number of masterpieces Now you may be wondering how did this guy become great without doing a whole lot I dont know how Wagner pulled that off But for most of us if we want to be more original we have to generate more ideas The Warby Parker founders when they were trying to name their company they needed something sophisticated unique with no negative associations to build a retail brand and they tested over 2000 possibilities before they finally put together Warby and Parker So if you put all this together what you see is that originals are not that different from the rest of us They feel fear and doubt They procrastinate They have bad ideas And sometimes its not in spite of those qualities but because of them that they succeed So when you see those things dont make the same mistake I did Dont write them off And when thats you dont count yourself out either Know that being quick to start but slow to finish can boost your creativity that you can motivate yourself by doubting your ideas and embracing the fear of failing to try and that you need a lot of bad ideas in order to get a few good ones Look being original is not easy but I have no doubt about this its the best way to improve the world around us Thank youOne of my earliest memories is of trying to wake up one of my relatives and not being able to And I was just a little kid so I didnt really understand why but as I got older I realized we had drug addiction in my family including later cocaine addiction Id been thinking about it a lot lately partly because its now exactly 100 years since drugs were first banned in the United States and Britain and we then imposed that on the rest of the world Its a century since we made this really fateful decision to take addicts and punish them and make them suffer because we believed that would deter them it would give them an incentive to stop And a few years ago I was looking at some of the addicts in my life who I love and trying to figure out if there was some way to help them And I realized there were loads of incredibly basic questions I just didnt know the answer to like what really causes addiction Why do we carry on with this approach that doesnt seem to be working and is there a better way out there that we could try instead So I read loads of stuff about it and I couldnt really find the answers I was looking for so I thought okay Ill go and sit with different people around the world who lived this and studied this and talk to them and see if I could learn from them And I didnt realize I would end up going over 30000 miles at the start but I ended up going and meeting loads of different people from a transgender crack dealer in Brownsville Brooklyn to a scientist who spends a lot of time feeding hallucinogens to mongooses to see if they like them  it turns out they do but only in very specific circumstances  to the only country thats ever decriminalized all drugs from cannabis to crack Portugal And the thing I realized that really blew my mind is almost everything we think we know about addiction is wrong and if we start to absorb the new evidence about addiction I think were going to have to change a lot more than our drug policies But lets start with what we think we know what I thought I knew Lets think about this middle row here Imagine all of you for 20 days now went off and used heroin three times a day Some of you look a little more enthusiastic than others at this prospect Dont worry its just a thought experiment Imagine you did that right What would happen Now we have a story about what would happen that weve been told for a century We think because there are chemical hooks in heroin as you took it for a while your body would become dependent on those hooks youd start to physically need them and at the end of those 20 days youd all be heroin addicts Right Thats what I thought First thing that alerted me to the fact that somethings not right with this story is when it was explained to me If I step out of this TED Talk today and I get hit by a car and I break my hip Ill be taken to hospital and Ill be given loads of diamorphine Diamorphine is heroin Its actually much better heroin than youre going to buy on the streets because the stuff you buy from a drug dealer is contaminated Actually very little of it is heroin whereas the stuff you get from the doctor is medically pure And youll be given it for quite a long period of time There are loads of people in this room you may not realize it youve taken quite a lot of heroin And anyone who is watching this anywhere in the world this is happening And if what we believe about addiction is right  those people are exposed to all those chemical hooks  What should happen They should become addicts This has been studied really carefully It doesnt happen you will have noticed if your grandmother had a hip replacement she didnt come out as a junkie And when I learned this it seemed so weird to me so contrary to everything Id been told everything I thought I knew I just thought it couldnt be right until I met a man called Bruce Alexander Hes a professor of psychology in Vancouver who carried out an incredible experiment I think really helps us to understand this issue Professor Alexander explained to me the idea of addiction weve all got in our heads that story comes partly from a series of experiments that were done earlier in the 20th century Theyre really simple You can do them tonight at home if you feel a little sadistic You get a rat and you put it in a cage and you give it two water bottles One is just water and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine If you do that the rat will almost always prefer the drug water and almost always kill itself quite quickly So there you go right Thats how we think it works In the 70s Professor Alexander comes along and he looks at this experiment and he noticed something He said ah were putting the rat in an empty cage Its got nothing to do except use these drugs Lets try something different So Professor Alexander built a cage that he called Rat Park which is basically heaven for rats Theyve got loads of cheese theyve got loads of colored balls theyve got loads of tunnels Crucially theyve got loads of friends They can have loads of sex And theyve got both the water bottles the normal water and the drugged water But heres the fascinating thing In Rat Park they dont like the drug water They almost never use it None of them ever use it compulsively None of them ever overdose You go from almost 100 percent overdose when theyre isolated to zero percent overdose when they have happy and connected lives Now when he first saw this Professor Alexander thought maybe this is just a thing about rats theyre quite different to us Maybe not as different as wed like but you know  But fortunately there was a human experiment into the exact same principle happening at the exact same time It was called the Vietnam War In Vietnam 20 percent of all American troops were using loads of heroin and if you look at the news reports from the time they were really worried because they thought my God were going to have hundreds of thousands of junkies on the streets of the United States when the war ends it made total sense Now those soldiers who were using loads of heroin were followed home The Archives of General Psychiatry did a really detailed study and what happened to them It turns out they didnt go to rehab They didnt go into withdrawal Ninetyfive percent of them just stopped Now if you believe the story about chemical hooks that makes absolutely no sense but Professor Alexander began to think there might be a different story about addiction He said what if addiction isnt about your chemical hooks What if addiction is about your cage What if addiction is an adaptation to your environment Looking at this there was another professor called Peter Cohen in the Netherlands who said maybe we shouldnt even call it addiction Maybe we should call it bonding Human beings have a natural and innate need to bond and when were happy and healthy well bond and connect with each other but if you cant do that because youre traumatized or isolated or beaten down by life you will bond with something that will give you some sense of relief Now that might be gambling that might be pornography that might be cocaine that might be cannabis but you will bond and connect with something because thats our nature Thats what we want as human beings And at first I found this quite a difficult thing to get my head around but one way that helped me to think about it is I can see Ive got over by my seat a bottle of water right Im looking at lots of you and lots of you have bottles of water with you Forget the drugs Forget the drug war Totally legally all of those bottles of water could be bottles of vodka right We could all be getting drunk  I might after this   but were not Now because youve been able to afford the approximately gazillion pounds that it costs to get into a TED Talk Im guessing you guys could afford to be drinking vodka for the next six months You wouldnt end up homeless Youre not going to do that and the reason youre not going to do that is not because anyones stopping you Its because youve got bonds and connections that you want to be present for Youve got work you love Youve got people you love Youve got healthy relationships And a core part of addiction I came to think and I believe the evidence suggests is about not being able to bear to be present in your life Now this has really significant implications The most obvious implications are for the War on Drugs In Arizona I went out with a group of women who were made to wear tshirts saying I was a drug addict and go out on chain gangs and dig graves while members of the public jeer at them and when those women get out of prison theyre going to have criminal records that mean theyll never work in the legal economy again Now thats a very extreme example obviously in the case of the chain gang but actually almost everywhere in the world we treat addicts to some degree like that We punish them We shame them We give them criminal records We put barriers between them reconnecting There was a doctor in Canada Dr Gabor Maté an amazing man who said to me if you wanted to design a system that would make addiction worse you would design that system Now theres a place that decided to do the exact opposite and I went there to see how it worked In the year 2000 Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe One percent of the population was addicted to heroin which is kind of mindblowing and every year they tried the American way more and more They punished people and stigmatized them and shamed them more and every year the problem got worse And one day the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition got together and basically said look we cant go on with a country where were having ever more people becoming heroin addicts Lets set up a panel of scientists and doctors to figure out what would genuinely solve the problem And they set up a panel led by an amazing man called Dr João Goulão to look at all this new evidence and they came back and they said Decriminalize all drugs from cannabis to crack but  and this is the crucial next step  take all the money we used to spend on cutting addicts off on disconnecting them and spend it instead on reconnecting them with society And thats not really what we think of as drug treatment in the United States and Britain So they do do residential rehab they do psychological therapy that does have some value But the biggest thing they did was the complete opposite of what we do a massive program of job creation for addicts and microloans for addicts to set up small businesses So say you used to be a mechanic When youre ready theyll go to a garage and theyll say if you employ this guy for a year well pay half his wages The goal was to make sure that every addict in Portugal had something to get out of bed for in the morning And when I went and met the addicts in Portugal what they said is as they rediscovered purpose they rediscovered bonds and relationships with the wider society Itll be 15 years this year since that experiment began and the results are in injecting drug use is down in Portugal according to the British Journal of Criminology by 50 percent fivezero percent Overdose is massively down HIV is massively down among addicts Addiction in every study is significantly down One of the ways you know its worked so well is that almost nobody in Portugal wants to go back to the old system Now thats the political implications I actually think theres a layer of implications to all this research below that We live in a culture where people feel really increasingly vulnerable to all sorts of addictions whether its to their smartphones or to shopping or to eating Before these talks began  you guys know this  we were told we werent allowed to have our smartphones on and I have to say a lot of you looked an awful lot like addicts who were told their dealer was going to be unavailable for the next couple of hours A lot of us feel like that and it might sound weird to say Ive been talking about how disconnection is a major driver of addiction and weird to say its growing because you think were the most connected society thats ever been surely But I increasingly began to think that the connections we have or think we have are like a kind of parody of human connection If you have a crisis in your life youll notice something It wont be your Twitter followers who come to sit with you It wont be your Facebook friends who help you turn it round Itll be your flesh and blood friends who you have deep and nuanced and textured facetoface relationships with and theres a study I learned about from Bill McKibben the environmental writer that I think tells us a lot about this It looked at the number of close friends the average American believes they can call on in a crisis That number has been declining steadily since the 1950s The amount of floor space an individual has in their home has been steadily increasing and I think thats like a metaphor for the choice weve made as a culture Weve traded floorspace for friends weve traded stuff for connections and the result is we are one of the loneliest societies there has ever been And Bruce Alexander the guy who did the Rat Park experiment says we talk all the time in addiction about individual recovery and its right to talk about that but we need to talk much more about social recovery Somethings gone wrong with us not just with individuals but as a group and weve created a society where for a lot of us life looks a whole lot more like that isolated cage and a whole lot less like Rat Park If Im honest this isnt why I went into it I didnt go in to the discover the political stuff the social stuff I wanted to know how to help the people I love And when I came back from this long journey and Id learned all this I looked at the addicts in my life and if youre really candid its hard loving an addict and theres going to be lots of people who know in this room You are angry a lot of the time and I think one of the reasons why this debate is so charged is because it runs through the heart of each of us right Everyone has a bit of them that looks at an addict and thinks I wish someone would just stop you And the kind of scripts were told for how to deal with the addicts in our lives is typified by I think the reality show Intervention if you guys have ever seen it I think everything in our lives is defined by reality TV but thats another TED Talk If youve ever seen the show Intervention its a pretty simple premise Get an addict all the people in their life gather them together confront them with what theyre doing and they say if you dont shape up were going to cut you off So what they do is they take the connection to the addict and they threaten it they make it contingent on the addict behaving the way they want And I began to think I began to see why that approach doesnt work and I began to think thats almost like the importing of the logic of the Drug War into our private lives So I was thinking how could I be Portuguese And what Ive tried to do now and I cant tell you I do it consistently and I cant tell you its easy is to say to the addicts in my life that I want to deepen the connection with them to say to them I love you whether youre using or youre not I love you whatever state youre in and if you need me Ill come and sit with you because I love you and I dont want you to be alone or to feel alone And I think the core of that message  youre not alone we love you  has to be at every level of how we respond to addicts socially politically and individually For 100 years now weve been singing war songs about addicts I think all along we should have been singing love songs to them because the opposite of addiction is not sobriety The opposite of addiction is connection Thank youWhat an intriguing group of individuals you are  to a psychologist Ive had the opportunity over the last couple of days of listening in on some of your conversations and watching you interact with each other And I think its fair to say already that there are 47 people in this audience at this moment displaying psychological symptoms I would like to discuss today And I thought you might like to know who you are But instead of pointing at you which would be gratuitous and intrusive I thought I would tell you a few facts and stories in which you may catch a glimpse of yourself Im in the field of research known as personality psychology which is part of a larger personality science which spans the full spectrum from neurons to narratives And what we try to do in our own way is to make sense of how each of us  each of you  is in certain respects like all other people like some other people and like no other person Now already you may be saying of yourself Im not intriguing I am the 46th most boring person in the Western Hemisphere Or you may say of yourself I am intriguing even if I am regarded by most people as a great thundering twit But it is your selfdiagnosed boringness and your inherent twitiness that makes me as a psychologist really fascinated by you So let me explain why this is so One of the most influential approaches in personality science is known as trait psychology and it aligns you along five dimensions which are normally distributed and that describe universally held aspects of difference between people They spell out the acronym OCEAN So O stands for open to experience versus those who are more closed C stands for conscientiousness in contrast to those with a more lackadaisical approach to life E  extroversion in contrast to more introverted people A  agreeable individuals in contrast to those decidedly not agreeable And N  neurotic individuals in contrast to those who are more stable All of these dimensions have implications for our wellbeing for how our life goes And so we know that for example openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and occasionally odd The conscientious people achieve it through sticking to deadlines to persevering as well as having some passion Extroversion and agreeableness are both conducive to working well with people Extroverts for example I find intriguing With my classes I sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality I tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow Did you know that Already some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow But extroverts amongst you are probably those who have not only tried but they have successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them Those are the extroverts Let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion because its consequential and its intriguing and it helps us understand what I call our three natures First our biogenic nature  our neurophysiology Second our sociogenic or second nature which has to do with the cultural and social aspects of our lives And third what makes you individually you  idiosyncratic  what I call your idiogenic nature Let me explain One of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation And that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting loud noises parties and social events here at TED  you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core They all gather together And Ive seen you The introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor where they are able to reduce stimulation  and may be misconstrued as being antisocial but youre not necessarily antisocial It may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation Sometimes its an internal stimulant from your body Caffeine for example works much better with extroverts than it does introverts When extroverts come into the office at nine oclock in the morning and say I really need a cup of coffee theyre not kidding  they really do Introverts do not do as well particularly if the tasks theyre engaged in  and theyve had some coffee  if those tasks are speeded and if theyre quantitative introverts may give the appearance of not being particularly quantitative But its a misconstrual So here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing were not always what seem to be and that takes me to my next point I should say before getting to this something about sexual intercourse although I may not have time And so if you would like me to  yes you would OK There are studies done on the frequency with which individuals engage in the conjugal act as broken down by male female introvert extrovert So I ask you How many times per minute  oh Im sorry that was a rat study  How many times per month do introverted men engage in the act 30 Extroverted men More or less Yes more 55  almost twice as much Introverted women 31 Extroverted women Frankly speaking as an introverted male which I will explain later  they are heroic 75 They not only handle all the male extroverts they pick up a few introverts as well We communicate differently extroverts and introverts Extroverts when they interact want to have lots of social encounter punctuated by closeness Theyd like to stand close for comfortable communication They like to have a lot of eye contact or mutual gaze We found in some research that they use more diminutive terms when they meet somebody So when an extrovert meets a Charles it rapidly becomes Charlie and then Chuck and then Chuckles Baby Whereas for introverts it remains Charles until hes given a pass to be more intimate by the person hes talking to We speak differently Extroverts prefer blackandwhite concrete simple language Introverts prefer  and I must again tell you that I am as extreme an introvert as you could possibly imagine  we speak differently We prefer contextually complex contingent weaselword sentences  More or less As it were Not to put too fine a point upon it  like that When we talk we sometimes talk past each other I had a consulting contract I shared with a colleague whos as different from me as two people can possibly be First his name is Tom Mine isnt Secondly hes six foot five I have a tendency not to be And thirdly hes as extroverted a person as you could find I am seriously introverted I overload so much I cant even have a cup of coffee after three in the afternoon and expect to sleep in the evening We had seconded to this project a fellow called Michael And Michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt So the person who seconded him asked Tom and me What do you make of Michael Well Ill tell you what Tom said in a minute He spoke in classic extrovertese And here is how extroverted ears heard what I said which is actually pretty accurate I said Well Michael does have a tendency at times of behaving in a way that some of us might see as perhaps more assertive than is normally called for Tom rolled his eyes and he said Brian thats what I said hes an asshole Now as an introvert I might gently allude to certain assholic qualities in this mans behavior but Im not going to lunge for the aword But the extrovert says If he walks like one if he talks like one I call him one And we go past each other Now is this something that we should be heedful of Of course Its important that we know this Is that all we are Are we just a bunch of traits No were not Remember youre like some other people and like no other person How about that idiosyncratic you As Elizabeth or as George you may share your extroversion or your neuroticism But are there some distinctively Elizabethan features of your behavior or Georgian of yours that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits That make us love you Not just because youre a certain type of person Im uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes I dont even think pigeons belong in pigeonholes So what is it that makes us different Its the doings that we have in our life  the personal projects You have a personal project right now but nobody may know it here It relates to your kid  youve been back three times to the hospital and they still dont know whats wrong Or it could be your mom And youd been acting out of character These are free traits Youre very agreeable but you act disagreeably in order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor in the hospital to get something for your mom or your child What are these free traits Theyre where we enact a script in order to advance a core project in our lives And they are what matters Dont ask people what type you are ask them What are your core projects in your life And we enact those free traits Im an introvert but I have a core project which is to profess Im a professor And I adore my students and I adore my field And I cant wait to tell them about whats new whats exciting what I cant wait to tell them about And so I act in an extroverted way because at eight in the morning the students need a little bit of humor a little bit of engagement to keep them going in arduous days of study But we need to be very careful when we act protractedly out of character Sometimes we may find that we dont take care of ourselves I find for example after a period of pseudoextroverted behavior I need to repair somewhere on my own As Susan Cain said in her Quiet book in a chapter that featured the strange Canadian professor who was teaching at the time at Harvard I sometimes go to the mens room to escape the slings and arrows of outrageous extroverts I remember one particular day when I was retired to a cubicle trying to avoid overstimulation And a real extrovert came in beside me  not right in my cubicle but in the next cubicle over  and I could hear various evacuatory noises which we hate  even our own thats why we flush during as well as after And then I heard this gravelly voice saying Hey is that Dr Little If anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert for six months its talking on the john Thats where Im going now Dont follow me Thank youWhat if I told you there was something that you can do right now that would have an immediate positive benefit for your brain including your mood and your focus And what if I told you that same thing could actually last a long time and protect your brain from different conditions like depression Alzheimers disease or dementia Would you do it Yes I am talking about the powerful effects of physical activity Simply moving your body has immediate longlasting and protective benefits for your brain And that can last for the rest of your life So what I want to do today is tell you a story about how I used my deep understanding of neuroscience as a professor of neuroscience to essentially do an experiment on myself in which I discovered the science underlying why exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today Now as a neuroscientist I know that our brains that is the thing in our head right now that is the most complex structure known to humankind But its one thing to talk about the brain and its another to see it So here is a real preserved human brain And its going to illustrate two key areas that we are going to talk about today The first is the prefrontal cortex right behind your forehead critical for things like decisionmaking focus attention and your personality The second key area is located in the temporal lobe shown right here You have two temporal lobes in your brain the right and the left and deep in the temporal lobe is a key structure critical for your ability to form and retain new longterm memories for facts and events And that structure is called the hippocampus So Ive always been fascinated with the hippocampus How could it be that an event that lasts just a moment say your first kiss or the moment your first child was born can form a memory that has changed your brain that lasts an entire lifetime Thats what I want to understand I wanted to start and record the activity of individual brain cells in the hippocampus as subjects were forming new memories And essentially try and decode how those brief bursts of electrical activity which is how neurons communicate with each other how those brief bursts either allowed us to form a new memory or did not But a few years ago I did something very unusual in science As a full professor of neural science I decided to completely switch my research program Because I encountered something that was so amazing with the potential to change so many lives that I had to study it I discovered and I experienced the brainchanging effects of exercise And I did it in a completely inadvertent way I was actually at the height of all the memory work that I was doing  data was pouring in I was becoming known in my field for all of this memory work And it should have been going great It was scientifically But when I stuck my head out of my lab door I noticed something I had no social life I spent too much time listening to those brain cells in a dark room by myself I didnt move my body at all I had gained 25 pounds And actually it took me many years to realize it I was actually miserable And I shouldnt be miserable And I went on a riverrafting trip  by myself because I had no social life And I came back  thinking Oh my God I was the weakest person on that trip And I came back with a mission I said Im never going to feel like the weakest person on a riverrafting trip again And thats what made me go to the gym And I focused my typeA personality on going to all the exercise classes at the gym I tried everything I went to kickbox dance yoga step class and at first it was really hard But what I noticed is that after every sweatinducing workout that I tried I had this great mood boost and this great energy boost And thats what kept me going back to the gym Well I started feeling stronger I started feeling better I even lost that 25 pounds And now fastforward a year and a half into this regular exercise program and I noticed something that really made me sit up and take notice I was sitting at my desk writing a research grant and a thought went through my mind that had never gone through my mind before And that thought was Gee grantwriting is going well today And all the scientists  yeah all the scientists always laugh when I say that because grantwriting never goes well It is so hard youre always pulling your hair out trying to come up with that milliondollarwinning idea But I realized that the grantwriting was going well because I was able to focus and maintain my attention for longer than I had before And my longterm memory  what I was studying in my own lab  seemed to be better in me And thats when I put it together Maybe all that exercise that I had included and added to my life was changing my brain Maybe I did an experiment on myself without even knowing it So as a curious neuroscientist I went to the literature to see what I could find about what we knew about the effects of exercise on the brain And what I found was an exciting and a growing literature that was essentially showing everything that I noticed in myself Better mood better energy better memory better attention And the more I learned the more I realized how powerful exercise was Which eventually led me to the big decision to completely shift my research focus And so now after several years of really focusing on this question Ive come to the following conclusion that exercise is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today for the following three reasons Number one it has immediate effects on your brain A single workout that you do will immediately increase levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine serotonin and noradrenaline That is going to increase your mood right after that workout exactly what I was feeling My lab showed that a single workout can improve your ability to shift and focus attention and that focus improvement will last for at least two hours And finally studies have shown that a single workout will improve your reaction times which basically means that you are going to be faster at catching that cup of Starbucks that falls off the counter which is very very important But these immediate effects are transient they help you right after What you have to do is do what I did that is change your exercise regime increase your cardiorespiratory function to get the longlasting effects And these effects are longlasting because exercise actually changes the brains anatomy physiology and function Lets start with my favorite brain area the hippocampus The hippocampus  or exercise actually produces brand new brain cells new brain cells in the hippocampus that actually increase its volume as well as improve your longterm memory OK And that including in you and me Number two the most common finding in neuroscience studies looking at effects of longterm exercise is improved attention function dependent on your prefrontal cortex You not only get better focus and attention but the volume of the hippocampus increases as well And finally you not only get immediate effects of mood with exercise but those last for a long time So you get longlasting increases in those good mood neurotransmitters But really the most transformative thing that exercise will do is its protective effects on your brain Here you can think about the brain like a muscle The more youre working out the bigger and stronger your hippocampus and prefrontal cortex gets Why is that important Because the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus are the two areas that are most susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases and normal cognitive decline in aging So with increased exercise over your lifetime youre not going to cure dementia or Alzheimers disease but what youre going to do is youre going to create the strongest biggest hippocampus and prefrontal cortex so it takes longer for these diseases to actually have an effect You can think of exercise therefore as a supercharged 401K for your brain OK And its even better because its free So this is the point in the talk where everybody says That sounds so interesting Wendy but I really will only want to know one thing And that is just tell me the minimum amount of exercise I need to get all these changes And so Im going to tell you the answer to that question First good news you dont have to become a triathlete to get these effects The rule of thumb is you want to get three to four times a week exercise minimum 30 minutes an exercise session and you want to get aerobic exercise in That is get your heart rate up And the good news is you dont have to go to the gym to get a very expensive gym membership Add an extra walk around the block in your power walk You see stairs  take stairs And powervacuuming can be as good as the aerobics class that you were going to take at the gym So Ive gone from memory pioneer to exercise explorer From going into the innermost workings of the brain to trying to understand how exercise can improve our brain function and my goal in my lab right now is to go beyond that rule of thumb that I just gave you  three to four times a week 30 minutes I want to understand the optimum exercise prescription for you at your age at your fitness level for your genetic background to maximize the effects of exercise today and also to improve your brain and protect your brain the best for the rest of your life But its one thing to talk about exercise and its another to do it So Im going to invoke my power as a certified exercise instructor to ask you all to stand up Were going to do just one minute of exercise Its callandresponse just do what I do say what I say and make sure you dont punch your neighbor OK Music Five six seven eight its right left right left And I say I am strong now Lets hear you Audience I am strong now Wendy Suzuki Ladies I am Wonder Womanstrong Lets hear you Audience I am Wonder Womanstrong WS New move  uppercut right and left I am inspired now You say it Audience I am inspired now WS Last move  pull it down right and left right and left I say I am on fire now You say it Audience I am on fire now WS And done OK good job Thank you I want to leave you with one last thought And that is bringing exercise in your life will not only give you a happier more protective life today but it will protect your brain from incurable diseases And in this way it will change the trajectory of your life for the better Thank you very much Thank youAt some point in our lives almost every one of us will have our heart broken My patient Kathy planned her wedding when she was in middle school She would meet her future husband by age 27 get engaged a year later and get married a year after that But when Kathy turned 27 she didnt find a husband She found a lump in her breast She went through many months of harsh chemotherapy and painful surgeries and then just as she was ready to jump back into the dating world she found a lump in her other breast and had to do it all over again Kathy recovered though and she was eager to resume her search for a husband as soon as her eyebrows grew back in When youre going on first dates in New York City you need to be able to express a wide range of emotions Soon afterwards she met Rich and fell in love The relationship was everything she hoped it would be Six months later after a lovely weekend in New England Rich made reservations at their favorite romantic restaurant Kathy knew he was going to propose and she could barely contain her excitement But Rich did not propose to Kathy that night He broke up with her As deeply as he cared for Kathy  and he did  he simply wasnt in love Kathy was shattered Her heart was truly broken and she now faced yet another recovery But five months after the breakup Kathy still couldnt stop thinking about Rich Her heart was still very much broken The question is Why Why was this incredibly strong and determined woman unable to marshal the same emotional resources that got her through four years of cancer treatments Why do so many of us flounder when were trying to recover from heartbreak Why do the same coping mechanisms that get us through all kinds of life challenges fail us so miserably when our heart gets broken In over 20 years of private practice I have seen people of every age and background face every manner of heartbreak and what Ive learned is this when your heart is broken the same instincts you ordinarily rely on will time and again lead you down the wrong path You simply cannot trust what your mind is telling you For example we know from studies of heartbroken people that having a clear understanding of why the relationship ended is really important for our ability to move on Yet time and again when we are offered a simple and honest explanation like the one Rich offered Kathy we reject it Heartbreak creates such dramatic emotional pain our mind tells us the cause must be equally dramatic And that gut instinct is so powerful it can make even the most reasonable and measured of us come up with mysteries and conspiracy theories where none exist Kathy became convinced something must have happened during her romantic getaway with Rich that soured him on the relationship and she became obsessed with figuring out what that was And so she spent countless hours going through every minute of that weekend in her mind searching her memory for clues that were not there Kathys mind tricked her into initiating this wild goose chase But what compelled her to commit to it for so many months Heartbreak is far more insidious than we realize There is a reason we keep going down one rabbit hole after another even when we know its going to make us feel worse Brain studies have shown that the withdrawal of romantic love activates the same mechanisms in our brain that get activated when addicts are withdrawing from substances like cocaine or opioids Kathy was going through withdrawal And since she could not have the heroin of actually being with Rich her unconscious mind chose the methadone of her memories with him Her instincts told her she was trying to solve a mystery but what she was actually doing was getting her fix This is what makes heartbreak so difficult to heal Addicts know theyre addicted They know when theyre shooting up But heartbroken people do not But you do now And if your heart is broken you cannot ignore that You have to recognize that as compelling as the urge is with every trip down memory lane every text you send every second you spend stalking your ex on social media you are just feeding your addiction deepening your emotional pain and complicating your recovery Getting over heartbreak is not a journey Its a fight and your reason is your strongest weapon There is no breakup explanation thats going to feel satisfying No rationale can take away the pain you feel So dont search for one dont wait for one just accept the one you were offered or make up one yourself and then put the question to rest because you need that closure to resist the addiction And you need something else as well you have to be willing to let go to accept that its over Otherwise your mind will feed on your hope and set you back Hope can be incredibly destructive when your heart is broken Heartbreak is a master manipulator The ease with which it gets our mind to do the absolute opposite of what we need in order to recover is remarkable One of the most common tendencies we have when our heart is broken is to idealize the person who broke it We spend hours remembering their smile how great they made us feel that time we hiked up the mountain and made love under the stars All that does is make our loss feel more painful We know that Yet we still allow our mind to cycle through one greatest hit after another like we were being held hostage by our own passiveaggressive Spotify playlist Heartbreak will make those thoughts pop into your mind And so to avoid idealizing you have to balance them out by remembering their frown not just their smile how bad they made you feel the fact that after the lovemaking you got lost coming down the mountain argued like crazy and didnt speak for two days What I tell my patients is to compile an exhaustive list of all the ways the person was wrong for you all the bad qualities all the pet peeves and then keep it on your phone And once you have your list you have to use it When I hear even a hint of idealizing or the faintest whiff of nostalgia in a session I go Phone please Your mind will try to tell you they were perfect But they were not and neither was the relationship And if you want to get over them you have to remind yourself of that frequently None of us is immune to heartbreak My patient Miguel was a 56yearold senior executive in a software company Five years after his wife died he finally felt ready to start dating again He soon met Sharon and a whirlwind romance ensued They introduced each other to their adult children after one month and they moved in together after two When middleaged people date they dont mess around Its like Love Actually meets The Fast and the Furious Miguel was happier than he had been in years But the night before their first anniversary Sharon left him She had decided to move to the West Coast to be closer to her children and she didnt want a longdistance relationship Miguel was totally blindsided and utterly devastated He barely functioned at work for many many months and he almost lost his job as a result Another consequence of heartbreak is that feeling alone and in pain can significantly impair our intellectual functioning especially when performing complex tasks involving logic and reasoning It temporarily lowers our IQ But it wasnt just the intensity of Miguels grief that confused his employers it was the duration Miguel was confused by this as well and really quite embarrassed by it Whats wrong with me he asked me in our session What adult spends almost a year getting over a oneyear relationship Actually many do Heartbreak shares all the hallmarks of traditional loss and grief insomnia intrusive thoughts immune system dysfunction Forty percent of people experience clinically measurable depression Heartbreak is a complex psychological injury It impacts us in a multitude of ways For example Sharon was both very social and very active She had dinners at the house every week She and Miguel went on camping trips with other couples Although Miguel was not religious he accompanied Sharon to church every Sunday where he was welcomed into the congregation Miguel didnt just lose his girlfriend he lost his entire social life the supportive community of Sharons church He lost his identity as a couple Now Miguel recognized the breakup had left this huge void in his life but what he failed to recognize is that it left far more than just one And that is crucial not just because it explains why heartbreak could be so devastating but because it tells us how to heal To fix your broken heart you have to identify these voids in your life and fill them and I mean all of them The voids in your identity you have to reestablish who you are and what your life is about The voids in your social life the missing activities even the empty spaces on the wall where pictures used to hang But none of that will do any good unless you prevent the mistakes that can set you back the unnecessary searches for explanations idealizing your ex instead of focusing on how they were wrong for you indulging thoughts and behaviors that still give them a starring role in this next chapter of your life when they shouldnt be an extra Getting over heartbreak is hard but if you refuse to be misled by your mind and you take steps to heal you can significantly minimize your suffering And it wont just be you who benefit from that Youll be more present with your friends more engaged with your family not to mention the billions of dollars of compromised productivity in the workplace that could be avoided So if you know someone who is heartbroken have compassion because social support has been found to be important for their recovery And have patience because its going to take them longer to move on than you think it should And if youre hurting know this its difficult it is a battle within your own mind and you have to be diligent to win But you do have weapons You can fight And you will heal Thank youHi Let me ask the audience a question Did you ever lie as a child If you did could you please raise your hand Wow This is the most honest group of people Ive ever met So for the last 20 years Ive been studying how children learn to tell lies And today Im going to share with you some of the discoveries we have made But to begin Im going to tell you a story from Mr Richard Messina who is my friend and an elementary school principal He got a phone call one day The caller says Mr Messina my son Johnny will not come to school today because hes sick Mr Messina asks Who am I speaking to please And the caller says I am my father So this story  sums up very nicely three common beliefs we have about children and lying One children only come to tell lies after entering elementary school Two children are poor liars We adults can easily detect their lies And three if children lie at a very young age there must be some character flaws with them and they are going to become pathological liars for life Well it turns out all of the three beliefs are wrong footnote footnote We have been playing guessing games with children all over the world Here is an example So in this game we asked children to guess the numbers on the cards And we tell them if they win the game they are going to get a big prize But in the middle of the game we make an excuse and leave the room And before we leave the room we tell them not to peek at the cards Of course we have hidden cameras in the room to watch their every move Because the desire to win the game is so strong more than 90 percent of children will peek as soon as we leave the room The crucial question is When we return and ask the children whether or not they have peeked will the children who peeked confess or lie about their transgression footnote footnote We found that regardless of gender country religion at two years of age 30 percent lie 70 percent tell the truth about their transgression At three years of age 50 percent lie and 50 percent tell the truth At four years of age more than 80 percent lie And after four years of age most children lie So as you can see lying is really a typical part of development And some children begin to tell lies as young as two years of age footnote footnote So now lets take a closer look at the younger children Why do some but not all young children lie In cooking you need good ingredients to cook good food And good lying requires two key ingredients The first key ingredient is theory of mind or the mindreading ability Mind reading is the ability to know that different people have different knowledge about the situation and the ability to differentiate between what I know and what you know Mind reading is important for lying because the basis of lying is that I know you dont know what I know Therefore I can lie to you footnote footnote The second key ingredient for good lying is selfcontrol It is the ability to control your speech your facial expression and your body language so that you can tell a convincing lie And we found that those young children who have more advanced mindreading and selfcontrol abilities tell lies earlier and are more sophisticated liars As it turns out these two abilities are also essential for all of us to function well in our society In fact deficits in mindreading and selfcontrol abilities are associated with serious developmental problems such as ADHD and autism So if you discover your twoyearold is telling his or her first lie instead of being alarmed you should celebrate  because it signals that your child has arrived at a new milestone of typical development Now are children poor liars Do you think you can easily detect their lies Would you like to give it a try Yes OK So Im going to show you two videos In the videos the children are going to respond to a researchers question Did you peek So try to tell me which child is lying and which child is telling the truth Heres child number one Are you ready Adult Did you peek Child No Kang Lee And this is child number two Adult Did you peek Child No footnote footnote KL OK if you think child number one is lying please raise your hand And if you think child number two is lying please raise your hand OK so as a matter of fact child number one is telling the truth child number two is lying Looks like many of you are terrible detectors of childrens lies Now we have played similar kinds of games with many many adults from all walks of life And we show them many videos In half of the videos the children lied In the other half of the videos the children told the truth And lets find out how these adults performed Because there are as many liars as truth tellers if you guess randomly theres a 50 percent chance youre going to get it right So if your accuracy is around 50 percent it means you are a terrible detector of childrens lies So lets start with undergrads and law school students who typically have limited experience with children No they cannot detect childrens lies Their performance is around chance Now how about social workers and childprotection lawyers who work with children on a daily basis Can they detect childrens lies No they cannot What about judges customs officers and police officers who deal with liars on a daily basis Can they detect childrens lies No they cannot What about parents Can parents detect other childrens lies No they cannot What about can parents detect their own childrens lies No they cannot So now you may ask why childrens lies are so difficult to detect Let me illustrate this with my own son Nathan This is his facial expression when he lies So when children lie their facial expression is typically neutral However behind this neutral expression the child is actually experiencing a lot of emotions such as fear guilt shame and maybe a little bit of liars delight Unfortunately such emotions are either fleeting or hidden Therefore its mostly invisible to us So in the last five years we have been trying to figure out a way to reveal these hidden emotions Then we made a discovery footnote footnote We know that underneath our facial skin theres a rich network of blood vessels When we experience different emotions our facial blood flow changes subtly And these changes are regulated by the autonomic system that is beyond our conscious control By looking at facial blood flow changes we can reveal peoples hidden emotions Unfortunately such emotionrelated facial blood flow changes are too subtle to detect by our naked eye So to help us reveal peoples facial emotions we have developed a new imaging technology we call transdermal optical imaging To do so we use a regular video camera to record people when they experience various hidden emotions And then using our image processing technology we can extract transdermal images of facial blood flow changes By looking at transdermal video images now we can easily see facial blood flow changes associated with the various hidden emotions And using this technology we can now reveal the hidden emotions associated with lying and therefore detect peoples lies We can do so noninvasively remotely inexpensively with an accuracy at about 85 percent which is far better than chance level And in addition we discovered a Pinocchio effect No not this Pinocchio effect This is the real Pinocchio effect When people lie the facial blood flow on the cheeks decreases and the facial blood flow on the nose increases Of course lying is not the only situation that will evoke our hidden emotions So then we asked ourselves in addition to detecting lies how can our technology be used One application is in education For example using this technology we can help this mathematics teacher to identify the student in his classroom who may experience high anxiety about the topic hes teaching so that he can help him And also we can use this in health care For example every day I Skype my parents who live thousands of miles away And using this technology I can not only find out whats going on in their lives but also simultaneously monitor their heart rate their stress level their mood and whether or not they are experiencing pain And perhaps in the future their risks for heart attack or hypertension And you may ask Can we use this also to reveal politicians emotions For example during a debate Well the answer is yes Using TV footage we could detect the politicians heart rate mood and stress and perhaps in the future whether or not they are lying to us We can also use this in marketing research for example to find out whether or not people like certain consumer products We can even use it in dating So for example if your date is smiling at you this technology can help you to determine whether she actually likes you or she is just trying to be nice to you And in this case she is just trying to be nice to you So transdermal optical imaging technology is at a very early stage of development Many new applications will come about that we dont know today However one thing I know for sure is that lying will never be the same again Thank you very muchThe last time I heard my sons voice was when he walked out the front door on his way to school He called out one word in the darkness Bye It was April 20 1999 Later that morning at Columbine High School my son Dylan and his friend Eric killed 12 students and a teacher and wounded more than 20 others before taking their own lives Thirteen innocent people were killed leaving their loved ones in a state of grief and trauma Others sustained injuries some resulting in disfigurement and permanent disability But the enormity of the tragedy cant be measured only by the number of deaths and injuries that took place Theres no way to quantify the psychological damage of those who were in the school or who took part in rescue or cleanup efforts Theres no way to assess the magnitude of a tragedy like Columbine especially when it can be a blueprint for other shooters who go on to commit atrocities of their own Columbine was a tidal wave and when the crash ended it would take years for the community and for society to comprehend its impact It has taken me years to try to accept my sons legacy The cruel behavior that defined the end of his life showed me that he was a completely different person from the one I knew Afterwards people asked How could you not know What kind of a mother were you I still ask myself those same questions Before the shootings I thought of myself as a good mom Helping my children become caring healthy responsible adults was the most important role of my life But the tragedy convinced me that I failed as a parent and its partially this sense of failure that brings me here today Aside from his father I was the one person who knew and loved Dylan the most If anyone could have known what was happening it should have been me right But I didnt know Today Im here to share the experience of what its like to be the mother of someone who kills and hurts For years after the tragedy I combed through memories trying to figure out exactly where I failed as a parent But there are no simple answers I cant give you any solutions All I can do is share what I have learned When I talk to people who didnt know me before the shootings I have three challenges to meet First when I walk into a room like this I never know if someone there has experienced loss because of what my son did I feel a need to acknowledge the suffering caused by a member of my family who isnt here to do it for himself So first with all of my heart Im sorry if my son has caused you pain The second challenge I have is that I must ask for understanding and even compassion when I talk about my sons death as a suicide Two years before he died he wrote on a piece of paper in a notebook that he was cutting himself He said that he was in agony and wanted to get a gun so he could end his life I didnt know about any of this until months after his death When I talk about his death as a suicide Im not trying to downplay the viciousness he showed at the end of his life Im trying to understand how his suicidal thinking led to murder After a lot of reading and talking with experts I have come to believe that his involvement in the shootings was rooted not in his desire to kill but in his desire to die The third challenge I have when I talk about my sons murdersuicide is that Im talking about mental health  excuse me  is that Im talking about mental health or brain health as I prefer to call it because its more concrete And in the same breath Im talking about violence The last thing I want to do is to contribute to the misunderstanding that already exists around mental illness Only a very small percent of those who have a mental illness are violent toward other people but of those who die by suicide its estimated that about 75 to maybe more than 90 percent have a diagnosable mental health condition of some kind As you all know very well our mental health care system is not equipped to help everyone and not everyone with destructive thoughts fits the criteria for a specific diagnosis Many who have ongoing feelings of fear or anger or hopelessness are never assessed or treated Too often they get our attention only if they reach a behavioral crisis If estimates are correct that about one to two percent of all suicides involves the murder of another person when suicide rates rise as they are rising for some populations the murdersuicide rates will rise as well I wanted to understand what was going on in Dylans mind prior to his death so I looked for answers from other survivors of suicide loss I did research and volunteered to help with fundraising events and whenever I could I talked with those who had survived their own suicidal crisis or attempt One of the most helpful conversations I had was with a coworker who overheard me talking to someone else in my office cubicle She heard me say that Dylan could not have loved me if he could do something as horrible as he did Later when she found me alone she apologized for overhearing that conversation but told me that I was wrong She said that when she was a young single mother with three small children she became severely depressed and was hospitalized to keep her safe At the time she was certain that her children would be better off if she died so she had made a plan to end her life She assured me that a mothers love was the strongest bond on Earth and that she loved her children more than anything in the world but because of her illness she was sure that they would be better off without her What she said and what Ive learned from others is that we do not make the socalled decision or choice to die by suicide in the same way that we choose what car to drive or where to go on a Saturday night When someone is in an extremely suicidal state they are in a stage four medical health emergency Their thinking is impaired and theyve lost access to tools of selfgovernance Even though they can make a plan and act with logic their sense of truth is distorted by a filter of pain through which they interpret their reality Some people can be very good at hiding this state and they often have good reasons for doing that Many of us have suicidal thoughts at some point but persistent ongoing thoughts of suicide and devising a means to die are symptoms of pathology and like many illnesses the condition has to be recognized and treated before a life is lost But my sons death was not purely a suicide It involved mass murder I wanted to know how his suicidal thinking became homicidal But research is sparse and there are no simple answers Yes he probably had ongoing depression He had a personality that was perfectionistic and selfreliant and that made him less likely to seek help from others He had experienced triggering events at the school that left him feeling debased and humiliated and mad And he had a complicated friendship with a boy who shared his feelings of rage and alienation and who was seriously disturbed controlling and homicidal And on top of this period in his life of extreme vulnerability and fragility Dylan found access to guns even though wed never owned any in our home It was appallingly easy for a 17yearold boy to buy guns both legally and illegally without my permission or knowledge And somehow 17 years and many school shootings later its still appallingly easy What Dylan did that day broke my heart and as trauma so often does it took a toll on my body and on my mind Two years after the shootings I got breast cancer and two years after that I began to have mental health problems On top of the constant perpetual grief I was terrified that I would run into a family member of someone Dylan had killed or be accosted by the press or by an angry citizen I was afraid to turn on the news afraid to hear myself being called a terrible parent or a disgusting person I started having panic attacks The first bout started four years after the shootings when I was getting ready for the depositions and would have to meet the victims families face to face The second round started six years after the shootings when I was preparing to speak publicly about murdersuicide for the first time at a conference Both episodes lasted several weeks The attacks happened everywhere in the hardware store in my office or even while reading a book in bed My mind would suddenly lock into this spinning cycle of terror and no matter how I hard I tried to calm myself down or reason my way out of it I couldnt do it It felt as if my brain was trying to kill me and then being afraid of being afraid consumed all of my thoughts Thats when I learned firsthand what it feels like to have a malfunctioning mind and thats when I truly became a brain health advocate With therapy and medication and selfcare life eventually returned to whatever could be thought of as normal under the circumstances When I looked back on all that had happened I could see that my sons spiral into dysfunction probably occurred over a period of about two years plenty of time to get him help if only someone had known that he needed help and known what to do Every time someone asks me How could you not have known it feels like a punch in the gut It carries accusation and taps into my feelings of guilt that no matter how much therapy Ive had I will never fully eradicate But heres something Ive learned if love were enough to stop someone who is suicidal from hurting themselves suicides would hardly ever happen But love is not enough and suicide is prevalent Its the second leading cause of death for people age 10 to 34 and 15 percent of American youth report having made a suicide plan in the last year Ive learned that no matter how much we want to believe we can we cannot know or control everything our loved ones think and feel and the stubborn belief that we are somehow different that someone we love would never think of hurting themselves or someone else can cause us to miss whats hidden in plain sight And if worst case scenarios do come to pass well have to learn to forgive ourselves for not knowing or for not asking the right questions or not finding the right treatment We should always assume that someone we love may be suffering regardless of what they say or how they act We should listen with our whole being without judgments and without offering solutions I know that I will live with this tragedy with these multiple tragedies for the rest of my life I know that in the minds of many what I lost cant compare to what the other families lost I know my struggle doesnt make theirs any easier I know there are even some who think I dont have the right to any pain but only to a life of permanent penance In the end what I know comes down to this the tragic fact is that even the most vigilant and responsible of us may not be able to help but for loves sake we must never stop trying to know the unknowable Thank youJust over a year ago for the third time in my life I ceased to exist I was having a small operation and my brain was filling with anesthetic I remember a sense of detachment and falling apart and a coldness And then I was back drowsy and disoriented but definitely there Now when you wake from a deep sleep you might feel confused about the time or anxious about oversleeping but theres always a basic sense of time having passed of a continuity between then and now Coming round from anesthesia is very different I could have been under for five minutes five hours five years or even 50 years I simply wasnt there It was total oblivion Anesthesia  its a modern kind of magic It turns people into objects and then we hope back again into people And in this process is one of the greatest remaining mysteries in science and philosophy footnote footnote How does consciousness happen Somehow within each of our brains the combined activity of many billions of neurons each one a tiny biological machine is generating a conscious experience And not just any conscious experience  your conscious experience right here and right now How does this happen Answering this question is so important because consciousness for each of us is all there is Without it theres no world theres no self theres nothing at all And when we suffer we suffer consciously whether its through mental illness or pain And if we can experience joy and suffering what about other animals Might they be conscious too Do they also have a sense of self And as computers get faster and smarter maybe there will come a point maybe not too far away when my iPhone develops a sense of its own existence footnote footnote I actually think the prospects for a conscious AI are pretty remote And I think this because my research is telling me that consciousness has less to do with pure intelligence and more to do with our nature as living and breathing organisms Consciousness and intelligence are very different things You dont have to be smart to suffer but you probably do have to be alive In the story Im going to tell you our conscious experiences of the world around us and of ourselves within it are kinds of controlled hallucinations that happen with through and because of our living bodies footnote footnote Now you might have heard that we know nothing about how the brain and body give rise to consciousness Some people even say its beyond the reach of science altogether But in fact the last 25 years have seen an explosion of scientific work in this area If you come to my lab at the University of Sussex youll find scientists from all different disciplines and sometimes even philosophers All of us together trying to understand how consciousness happens and what happens when it goes wrong And the strategy is very simple Id like you to think about consciousness in the way that weve come to think about life At one time people thought the property of being alive could not be explained by physics and chemistry  that life had to be more than just mechanism But people no longer think that As biologists got on with the job of explaining the properties of living systems in terms of physics and chemistry  things like metabolism reproduction homeostasis  the basic mystery of what life is started to fade away and people didnt propose any more magical solutions like a force of life or an élan vital So as with life so with consciousness Once we start explaining its properties in terms of things happening inside brains and bodies the apparently insoluble mystery of what consciousness is should start to fade away At least thats the plan footnote footnote So lets get started What are the properties of consciousness What should a science of consciousness try to explain Well for today Id just like to think of consciousness in two different ways There are experiences of the world around us full of sights sounds and smells theres multisensory panoramic 3D fully immersive inner movie And then theres conscious self The specific experience of being you or being me The lead character in this inner movie and probably the aspect of consciousness we all cling to most tightly Lets start with experiences of the world around us and with the important idea of the brain as a prediction engine footnote footnote Imagine being a brain Youre locked inside a bony skull trying to figure whats out there in the world Theres no lights inside the skull Theres no sound either All youve got to go on is streams of electrical impulses which are only indirectly related to things in the world whatever they may be So perception  figuring out whats there  has to be a process of informed guesswork in which the brain combines these sensory signals with its prior expectations or beliefs about the way the world is to form its best guess of what caused those signals The brain doesnt hear sound or see light What we perceive is its best guess of whats out there in the world Let me give you a couple of examples of all this You might have seen this illusion before but Id like you to think about it in a new way If you look at those two patches A and B they should look to you to be very different shades of gray right But they are in fact exactly the same shade And I can illustrate this If I put up a second version of the image here and join the two patches with a graycolored bar you can see theres no difference Its exactly the same shade of gray And if you still dont believe me Ill bring the bar across and join them up Its a single colored block of gray theres no difference at all This isnt any kind of magic trick Its the same shade of gray but take it away again and it looks different So whats happening here is that the brain is using its prior expectations built deeply into the circuits of the visual cortex that a cast shadow dims the appearance of a surface so that we see B as lighter than it really is Heres one more example which shows just how quickly the brain can use new predictions to change what we consciously experience Have a listen to this Sounded strange right Have a listen again and see if you can get anything Still strange Now listen to this Anil Seth I think Brexit is a really terrible idea Which I do So you heard some words there right Now listen to the first sound again Im just going to replay it Yeah So you can now hear words there Once more for luck footnote footnote OK so whats going on here The remarkable thing is the sensory information coming into the brain hasnt changed at all All thats changed is your brains best guess of the causes of that sensory information And that changes what you consciously hear All this puts the brain basis of perception in a bit of a different light Instead of perception depending largely on signals coming into the brain from the outside world it depends as much if not more on perceptual predictions flowing in the opposite direction We dont just passively perceive the world we actively generate it The world we experience comes as much if not more from the inside out as from the outside in footnote footnote Let me give you one more example of perception as this active constructive process Here weve combined immersive virtual reality with image processing to simulate the effects of overly strong perceptual predictions on experience In this panoramic video weve transformed the world  which is in this case Sussex campus  into a psychedelic playground Weve processed the footage using an algorithm based on Googles Deep Dream to simulate the effects of overly strong perceptual predictions In this case to see dogs And you can see this is a very strange thing When perceptual predictions are too strong as they are here the result looks very much like the kinds of hallucinations people might report in altered states or perhaps even in psychosis Now think about this for a minute If hallucination is a kind of uncontrolled perception then perception right here and right now is also a kind of hallucination but a controlled hallucination in which the brains predictions are being reined in by sensory information from the world In fact were all hallucinating all the time including right now Its just that when we agree about our hallucinations we call that reality footnote footnote Now Im going to tell you that your experience of being a self the specific experience of being you is also a controlled hallucination generated by the brain This seems a very strange idea right Yes visual illusions might deceive my eyes but how could I be deceived about what it means to be me For most of us the experience of being a person is so familiar so unified and so continuous that its difficult not to take it for granted But we shouldnt take it for granted There are in fact many different ways we experience being a self Theres the experience of having a body and of being a body There are experiences of perceiving the world from a first person point of view There are experiences of intending to do things and of being the cause of things that happen in the world And there are experiences of being a continuous and distinctive person over time built from a rich set of memories and social interactions footnote footnote Many experiments show and psychiatrists and neurologists know very well that these different ways in which we experience being a self can all come apart What this means is the basic background experience of being a unified self is a rather fragile construction of the brain Another experience which just like all others requires explanation So lets return to the bodily self How does the brain generate the experience of being a body and of having a body Well just the same principles apply The brain makes its best guess about what is and what is not part of its body And theres a beautiful experiment in neuroscience to illustrate this And unlike most neuroscience experiments this is one you can do at home All you need is one of these And a couple of paintbrushes In the rubber hand illusion a persons real hand is hidden from view and that fake rubber hand is placed in front of them Then both hands are simultaneously stroked with a paintbrush while the person stares at the fake hand Now for most people after a while this leads to the very uncanny sensation that the fake hand is in fact part of their body And the idea is that the congruence between seeing touch and feeling touch on an object that looks like hand and is roughly where a hand should be is enough evidence for the brain to make its best guess that the fake hand is in fact part of the body So you can measure all kinds of clever things You can measure skin conductance and startle responses but theres no need Its clear the guy in blue has assimilated the fake hand This means that even experiences of what our body is is a kind of best guessing  a kind of controlled hallucination by the brain footnote footnote Theres one more thing We dont just experience our bodies as objects in the world from the outside we also experience them from within We all experience the sense of being a body from the inside And sensory signals coming from the inside of the body are continually telling the brain about the state of the internal organs how the heart is doing what the blood pressure is like lots of things This kind of perception which we call interoception is rather overlooked But its critically important because perception and regulation of the internal state of the body  well thats what keeps us alive footnote footnote Heres another version of the rubber hand illusion This is from our lab at Sussex And here people see a virtual reality version of their hand which flashes red and back either in time or out of time with their heartbeat And when its flashing in time with their heartbeat people have a stronger sense that its in fact part of their body So experiences of having a body are deeply grounded in perceiving our bodies from within Theres one last thing I want to draw your attention to which is that experiences of the body from the inside are very different from experiences of the world around us When I look around me the world seems full of objects  tables chairs rubber hands people you lot  even my own body in the world I can perceive it as an object from the outside But my experiences of the body from within theyre not like that at all I dont perceive my kidneys here my liver here my spleen  I dont know where my spleen is but its somewhere I dont perceive my insides as objects In fact I dont experience them much at all unless they go wrong And this is important I think Perception of the internal state of the body isnt about figuring out whats there its about control and regulation  keeping the physiological variables within the tight bounds that are compatible with survival When the brain uses predictions to figure out whats there we perceive objects as the causes of sensations When the brain uses predictions to control and regulate things we experience how well or how badly that control is going So our most basic experiences of being a self of being an embodied organism are deeply grounded in the biological mechanisms that keep us alive And when we follow this idea all the way through we can start to see that all of our conscious experiences since they all depend on the same mechanisms of predictive perception all stem from this basic drive to stay alive We experience the world and ourselves with through and because of our living bodies footnote footnote Let me bring things together stepbystep What we consciously see depends on the brains best guess of whats out there Our experienced world comes from the inside out not just the outside in The rubber hand illusion shows that this applies to our experiences of what is and what is not our body And these selfrelated predictions depend critically on sensory signals coming from deep inside the body And finally experiences of being an embodied self are more about control and regulation than figuring out whats there So our experiences of the world around us and ourselves within it  well theyre kinds of controlled hallucinations that have been shaped over millions of years of evolution to keep us alive in worlds full of danger and opportunity We predict ourselves into existence footnote footnote Now I leave you with three implications of all this First just as we can misperceive the world we can misperceive ourselves when the mechanisms of prediction go wrong Understanding this opens many new opportunities in psychiatry and neurology because we can finally get at the mechanisms rather than just treating the symptoms in conditions like depression and schizophrenia Second what it means to be me cannot be reduced to or uploaded to a software program running on a robot however smart or sophisticated We are biological fleshandblood animals whose conscious experiences are shaped at all levels by the biological mechanisms that keep us alive Just making computers smarter is not going to make them sentient Finally our own individual inner universe our way of being conscious is just one possible way of being conscious And even human consciousness generally  its just a tiny region in a vast space of possible consciousnesses Our individual self and worlds are unique to each of us but theyre all grounded in biological mechanisms shared with many other living creatures footnote footnote Now these are fundamental changes in how we understand ourselves but I think they should be celebrated because as so often in science from Copernicus  were not at the center of the universe  to Darwin  were related to all other creatures  to the present day With a greater sense of understanding comes a greater sense of wonder and a greater realization that we are part of and not apart from the rest of nature And  when the end of consciousness comes theres nothing to be afraid of Nothing at all Thank youSo what does it mean for a machine to be athletic We will demonstrate the concept of machine athleticism and the research to achieve it with the help of these flying machines called quadrocopters or quads for short Quads have been around for a long time Theyre so popular these days because theyre mechanically simple By controlling the speeds of these four propellers these machines can roll pitch yaw and accelerate along their common orientation On board are also a battery a computer various sensors and wireless radios Quads are extremely agile but this agility comes at a cost They are inherently unstable and they need some form of automatic feedback control in order to be able to fly footnote footnote So how did it just do that Cameras on the ceiling and a laptop serve as an indoor global positioning system Its used to locate objects in the space that have these reflective markers on them This data is then sent to another laptop that is running estimation and control algorithms which in turn sends commands to the quad which is also running estimation and control algorithms The bulk of our research is algorithms Its the magic that brings these machines to life So how does one design the algorithms that create a machine athlete We use something broadly called modelbased design We first capture the physics with a mathematical model of how the machines behave We then use a branch of mathematics called control theory to analyze these models and also to synthesize algorithms for controlling them For example thats how we can make the quad hover We first captured the dynamics with a set of differential equations We then manipulate these equations with the help of control theory to create algorithms that stabilize the quad Let me demonstrate the strength of this approach Suppose that we want this quad to not only hover but to also balance this pole With a little bit of practice its pretty straightforward for a human being to do this although we do have the advantage of having two feet on the ground and the use of our very versatile hands It becomes a little bit more difficult when I only have one foot on the ground and when I dont use my hands Notice how this pole has a reflective marker on top which means that it can be located in the space Oh footnote footnote You can notice that this quad is making fine adjustments to keep the pole balanced How did we design the algorithms to do this We added the mathematical model of the pole to that of the quad Once we have a model of the combined quadpole system we can use control theory to create algorithms for controlling it Here you see that its stable and even if I give it little nudges it goes back  to the nice balanced position We can also augment the model to include where we want the quad to be in space Using this pointer made out of reflective markers I can point to where I want the quad to be in space a fixed distance away from me The key to these acrobatic maneuvers is algorithms designed with the help of mathematical models and control theory Lets tell the quad to come back here and let the pole drop and I will next demonstrate the importance of understanding physical models and the workings of the physical world Notice how the quad lost altitude when I put this glass of water on it Unlike the balancing pole I did not include the mathematical model of the glass in the system In fact the system doesnt even know that the glass is there Like before I could use the pointer to tell the quad where I want it to be in space Okay you should be asking yourself why doesnt the water fall out of the glass Two facts The first is that gravity acts on all objects in the same way The second is that the propellers are all pointing in the same direction of the glass pointing up You put these two things together the net result is that all side forces on the glass are small and are mainly dominated by aerodynamic effects which at these speeds are negligible And thats why you dont need to model the glass It naturally doesnt spill no matter what the quad does Oh The lesson here is that some highperformance tasks are easier than others and that understanding the physics of the problem tells you which ones are easy and which ones are hard In this instance carrying a glass of water is easy Balancing a pole is hard Weve all heard stories of athletes performing feats while physically injured Can a machine also perform with extreme physical damage Conventional wisdom says that you need at least four fixed motor propeller pairs in order to fly because there are four degrees of freedom to control roll pitch yaw and acceleration Hexacopters and octocopters with six and eight propellers can provide redundancy but quadrocopters are much more popular because they have the minimum number of fixed motor propeller pairs four Or do they Oh If we analyze the mathematical model of this machine with only two working propellers we discover that theres an unconventional way to fly it We relinquish control of yaw but roll pitch and acceleration can still be controlled with algorithms that exploit this new configuration Mathematical models tell us exactly when and why this is possible In this instance this knowledge allows us to design novel machine architectures or to design clever algorithms that gracefully handle damage just like human athletes do instead of building machines with redundancy footnote footnote We cant help but hold our breath when we watch a diver somersaulting into the water or when a vaulter is twisting in the air the ground fast approaching Will the diver be able to pull off a rip entry Will the vaulter stick the landing Suppose we want this quad here to perform a triple flip and finish off at the exact same spot that it started This maneuver is going to happen so quickly that we cant use position feedback to correct the motion during execution There simply isnt enough time Instead what the quad can do is perform the maneuver blindly observe how it finishes the maneuver and then use that information to modify its behavior so that the next flip is better Similar to the diver and the vaulter it is only through repeated practice that the maneuver can be learned and executed to the highest standard Striking a moving ball is a necessary skill in many sports How do we make a machine do what an athlete does seemingly without effort This quad has a racket strapped onto its head with a sweet spot roughly the size of an apple so not too large The following calculations are made every 20 milliseconds or 50 times per second We first figure out where the ball is going We then next calculate how the quad should hit the ball so that it flies to where it was thrown from Third a trajectory is planned that carries the quad from its current state to the impact point with the ball Fourth we only execute 20 milliseconds worth of that strategy Twenty milliseconds later the whole process is repeated until the quad strikes the ball Machines can not only perform dynamic maneuvers on their own they can do it collectively These three quads are cooperatively carrying a sky net They perform an extremely dynamic and collective maneuver to launch the ball back to me Notice that at full extension these quads are vertical In fact when fully extended this is roughly five times greater than what a bungee jumper feels at the end of their launch The algorithms to do this are very similar to what the single quad used to hit the ball back to me Mathematical models are used to continuously replan a cooperative strategy 50 times per second Everything we have seen so far has been about the machines and their capabilities What happens when we couple this machine athleticism with that of a human being What I have in front of me is a commercial gesture sensor mainly used in gaming It can recognize what my various body parts are doing in real time Similar to the pointer that I used earlier we can use this as inputs to the system We now have a natural way of interacting with the raw athleticism of these quads with my gestures footnote footnote Interaction doesnt have to be virtual It can be physical Take this quad for example Its trying to stay at a fixed point in space If I try to move it out of the way it fights me and moves back to where it wants to be We can change this behavior however We can use mathematical models to estimate the force that Im applying to the quad Once we know this force we can also change the laws of physics as far as the quad is concerned of course Here the quad is behaving as if it were in a viscous fluid We now have an intimate way of interacting with a machine I will use this new capability to position this cameracarrying quad to the appropriate location for filming the remainder of this demonstration So we can physically interact with these quads and we can change the laws of physics Lets have a little bit of fun with this For what you will see next these quads will initially behave as if they were on Pluto As time goes on gravity will be increased until were all back on planet Earth but I assure you we wont get there Okay here goes Whew Youre all thinking now these guys are having way too much fun and youre probably also asking yourself why exactly are they building machine athletes Some conjecture that the role of play in the animal kingdom is to hone skills and develop capabilities Others think that it has more of a social role that its used to bind the group Similarly we use the analogy of sports and athleticism to create new algorithms for machines to push them to their limits What impact will the speed of machines have on our way of life Like all our past creations and innovations they may be used to improve the human condition or they may be misused and abused This is not a technical choice we are faced with its a social one Lets make the right choice the choice that brings out the best in the future of machines just like athleticism in sports can bring out the best in us Let me introduce you to the wizards behind the green curtain Theyre the current members of the Flying Machine Arena research team Federico Augugliaro Dario Brescianini Markus Hehn Sergei Lupashin Mark Muller and Robin Ritz Look out for them Theyre destined for great things Thank youFirst a video Yes it is a scrambled egg But as you look at it I hope youll begin to feel just slightly uneasy Because you may notice that whats actually happening is that the egg is unscrambling itself And youll now see the yolk and the white have separated And now theyre going to be poured back into the egg And we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works A scrambled egg is mush  tasty mush  but its mush An egg is a beautiful sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things such as chickens And we know in our heart of hearts that the universe does not travel from mush to complexity In fact this gut instinct is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics the second law of thermodynamics or the law of entropy What that says basically is that the general tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure to lack of order lack of structure  in fact to mush And thats why that video feels a bit strange And yet look around us What we see around us is staggering complexity Eric Beinhocker estimates that in New York City alone there are some 10 billion SKUs or distinct commodities being traded Thats hundreds of times as many species as there are on Earth And theyre being traded by a species of almost seven billion individuals who are linked by trade travel and the Internet into a global system of stupendous complexity So heres a great puzzle in a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics how is it possible to generate the sort of complexity Ive described the sort of complexity represented by you and me and the convention center Well the answer seems to be the universe can create complexity but with great difficulty In pockets there appear what my colleague Fred Spier calls Goldilocks conditions  not too hot not too cold just right for the creation of complexity And slightly more complex things appear And where you have slightly more complex things you can get slightly more complex things And in this way complexity builds stage by stage Each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe We refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments And at each threshold the going gets tougher The complex things get more fragile more vulnerable the Goldilocks conditions get more stringent and its more difficult to create complexity Now we as extremely complex creatures desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility And thats the story that we tell in big history But to do it you have do something that may at first sight seem completely impossible You have to survey the whole history of the universe So lets do it Lets begin by winding the timeline back 137 billion years to the beginning of time Around us theres nothing Theres not even time or space Imagine the darkest emptiest thing you can and cube it a gazillion times and thats where we are And then suddenly bang A universe appears an entire universe And weve crossed our first threshold The universe is tiny its smaller than an atom Its incredibly hot It contains everything thats in todays universe so you can imagine its busting And its expanding at incredible speed And at first its just a blur but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur Within the first second energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity And energy does something else quite magical it congeals to form matter  quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons And all of that happens in the first second Now we move forward 380000 years Thats twice as long as humans have been on this planet And now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium Now I want to pause for a moment 380000 years after the origins of the universe because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage We know above all that it was extremely simple It consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms and they have no structure Theyre really a sort of cosmic mush But thats not completely true Recent studies by satellites such as the WMAP satellite have shown that in fact there are just tiny differences in that background What you see here the blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas These are tiny differences but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity And this is how it works Gravity is more powerful where theres more stuff So where you get slightly denser areas gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms So we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion clouds And each cloud is compacted gravity gets more powerful as density increases the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud and then at the center the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of 10 million degrees protons start to fuse theres a huge release of energy and  bam We have our first stars From about 200 million years after the Big Bang stars begin to appear all through the universe billions of them And the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex Stars will create the Goldilocks conditions for crossing two new thresholds When very large stars die they create temperatures so high that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations to form all the elements of the periodic table If like me youre wearing a gold ring it was forged in a supernova explosion So now the universe is chemically more complex And in a chemically more complex universe its possible to make more things And what starts happening is that around young suns young stars all these elements combine they swirl around the energy of the star stirs them around they form particles they form snowflakes they form little dust motes they form rocks they form asteroids and eventually they form planets and moons And that is how our solar system was formed four and a half billion years ago Rocky planets like our Earth are significantly more complex than stars because they contain a much greater diversity of materials So weve crossed a fourth threshold of complexity Now the going gets tougher The next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile significantly more vulnerable but theyre also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity Im talking of course about living organisms Living organisms are created by chemistry We are huge packages of chemicals So chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force That operates over smaller scales than gravity which explains why you and I are smaller than stars or planets Now what are the ideal conditions for chemistry What are the Goldilocks conditions Well first you need energy but not too much In the center of a star theres so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again But not too little In intergalactic space theres so little energy that atoms cant combine What you want is just the right amount and planets it turns out are just right because theyre close to stars but not too close You also need a great diversity of chemical elements and you need liquids such as water Why Well in gases atoms move past each other so fast that they cant hitch up In solids atoms are stuck together they cant move In liquids they can cruise and cuddle and link up to form molecules Now where do you find such Goldilocks conditions Well planets are great and our early Earth was almost perfect It was just the right distance from its star to contain huge oceans of liquid water And deep beneath those oceans at cracks in the Earths crust youve got heat seeping up from inside the Earth and youve got a great diversity of elements So at those deep oceanic vents fantastic chemistry began to happen and atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations But of course life is more than just exotic chemistry How do you stabilize those huge molecules that seem to be viable Well its here that life introduces an entirely new trick You dont stabilize the individual you stabilize the template the thing that carries information and you allow the template to copy itself And DNA of course is the beautiful molecule that contains that information Youll be familiar with the double helix of DNA Each rung contains information So DNA contains information about how to make living organisms And DNA also copies itself So it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean So the information spreads Notice that information has become part of our story The real beauty of DNA though is in its imperfections As it copies itself once in every billion rungs there tends to be an error And what that means is that DNA is in effect learning Its accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work So DNAs learning and its building greater diversity and greater complexity And we can see this happening over the last four billion years For most of that time of life on Earth living organisms have been relatively simple  single cells But they had great diversity and inside great complexity Then from about 600 to 800 million years ago multicelled organisms appear You get fungi you get fish you get plants you get amphibia you get reptiles and then of course you get the dinosaurs And occasionally there are disasters Sixtyfive million years ago an asteroid landed on Earth near the Yucatan Peninsula creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war and the dinosaurs were wiped out Terrible news for the dinosaurs but great news for our mammalian ancestors who flourished in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs And we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began 65 million years ago with the landing of an asteroid Humans appeared about 200000 years ago And I believe we count as a threshold in this great story Let me explain why Weve seen that DNA learns in a sense it accumulates information But it is so slow DNA accumulates information through random errors some of which just happen to work But DNA had actually generated a faster way of learning it had produced organisms with brains and those organisms can learn in real time They accumulate information they learn The sad thing is when they die the information dies with them Now what makes humans different is human language We are blessed with a language a system of communication so powerful and so precise that we can share what weve learned with such precision that it can accumulate in the collective memory And that means it can outlast the individuals who learned that information and it can accumulate from generation to generation And thats why as a species were so creative and so powerful and thats why we have a history We seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift I call this ability collective learning Its what makes us different We can see it at work in the earliest stages of human history We evolved as a species in the savanna lands of Africa but then you see humans migrating into new environments into desert lands into jungles into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia  tough tough environment  into the Americas into Australasia Each migration involved learning  learning new ways of exploiting the environment new ways of dealing with their surroundings Then 10000 years ago exploiting a sudden change in global climate with the end of the last ice age humans learned to farm Farming was an energy bonanza And exploiting that energy human populations multiplied Human societies got larger denser more interconnected And then from about 500 years ago humans began to link up globally through shipping through trains through telegraph through the Internet until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost seven billion individuals And that brain is learning at warp speed And in the last 200 years something else has happened Weve stumbled on another energy bonanza in fossil fuels So fossil fuels and collective learning together explain the staggering complexity we see around us So  Here we are back at the convention center Weve been on a journey a return journey of 137 billion years I hope you agree this is a powerful story And its a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role But it also contains warnings Collective learning is a very very powerful force and its not clear that we humans are in charge of it I remember very vividly as a child growing up in England living through the Cuban Missile Crisis For a few days the entire biosphere seemed to be on the verge of destruction And the same weapons are still here and they are still armed If we avoid that trap others are waiting for us Were burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seem to be undermining the Goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last 10000 years So what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us but it can also show us our power with collective learning And now finally  this is what I want I want my grandson Daniel and his friends and his generation throughout the world to know the story of big history and to know it so well that they understand both the challenges that face us and the opportunities that face us And thats why a group of us are building a free online syllabus in big history for highschool students throughout the world We believe that big history will be a vital intellectual tool for them as Daniel and his generation face the huge challenges and also the huge opportunities ahead of them at this threshold moment in the history of our beautiful planet I thank you for your attentionI used to think the whole purpose of life was pursuing happiness Everyone said the path to happiness was success so I searched for that ideal job that perfect boyfriend that beautiful apartment But instead of ever feeling fulfilled I felt anxious and adrift And I wasnt alone my friends  they struggled with this too footnote footnote Eventually I decided to go to graduate school for positive psychology to learn what truly makes people happy But what I discovered there changed my life The data showed that chasing happiness can make people unhappy And what really struck me was this the suicide rate has been rising around the world and it recently reached a 30year high in America Even though life is getting objectively better by nearly every conceivable standard more people feel hopeless depressed and alone Theres an emptiness gnawing away at people and you dont have to be clinically depressed to feel it Sooner or later I think we all wonder Is this all there is And according to the research what predicts this despair is not a lack of happiness Its a lack of something else a lack of having meaning in life footnote footnote But that raised some questions for me Is there more to life than being happy And whats the difference between being happy and having meaning in life Many psychologists define happiness as a state of comfort and ease feeling good in the moment Meaning though is deeper The renowned psychologist Martin Seligman says meaning comes from belonging to and serving something beyond yourself and from developing the best within you Our culture is obsessed with happiness but I came to see that seeking meaning is the more fulfilling path And the studies show that people who have meaning in life theyre more resilient they do better in school and at work and they even live longer So this all made me wonder How can we each live more meaningfully To find out I spent five years interviewing hundreds of people and reading through thousands of pages of psychology neuroscience and philosophy Bringing it all together I found that there are what I call four pillars of a meaningful life And we can each create lives of meaning by building some or all of these pillars in our lives footnote footnote The first pillar is belonging Belonging comes from being in relationships where youre valued for who you are intrinsically and where you value others as well But some groups and relationships deliver a cheap form of belonging youre valued for what you believe for who you hate not for who you are True belonging springs from love It lives in moments among individuals and its a choice  you can choose to cultivate belonging with others Heres an example Each morning my friend Jonathan buys a newspaper from the same street vendor in New York They dont just conduct a transaction though They take a moment to slow down talk and treat each other like humans But one time Jonathan didnt have the right change and the vendor said Dont worry about it But Jonathan insisted on paying so he went to the store and bought something he didnt need to make change But when he gave the money to the vendor the vendor drew back He was hurt He was trying to do something kind but Jonathan had rejected him footnote footnote I think we all reject people in small ways like this without realizing it I do Ill walk by someone I know and barely acknowledge them Ill check my phone when someones talking to me These acts devalue others They make them feel invisible and unworthy But when you lead with love you create a bond that lifts each of you up footnote footnote For many people belonging is the most essential source of meaning those bonds to family and friends For others the key to meaning is the second pillar purpose Now finding your purpose is not the same thing as finding that job that makes you happy Purpose is less about what you want than about what you give A hospital custodian told me her purpose is healing sick people Many parents tell me My purpose is raising my children The key to purpose is using your strengths to serve others Of course for many of us that happens through work Thats how we contribute and feel needed But that also means that issues like disengagement at work unemployment low labor force participation  these arent just economic problems theyre existential ones too Without something worthwhile to do people flounder Of course you dont have to find purpose at work but purpose gives you something to live for some why that drives you forward footnote footnote The third pillar of meaning is also about stepping beyond yourself but in a completely different way transcendence Transcendent states are those rare moments when youre lifted above the hustle and bustle of daily life your sense of self fades away and you feel connected to a higher reality For one person I talked to transcendence came from seeing art For another person it was at church For me Im a writer and it happens through writing Sometimes I get so in the zone that I lose all sense of time and place These transcendent experiences can change you One study had students look up at 200feettall eucalyptus trees for one minute But afterwards they felt less selfcentered and they even behaved more generously when given the chance to help someone footnote footnote Belonging purpose transcendence Now the fourth pillar of meaning Ive found tends to surprise people The fourth pillar is storytelling the story you tell yourself about yourself Creating a narrative from the events of your life brings clarity It helps you understand how you became you But we dont always realize that were the authors of our stories and can change the way were telling them Your life isnt just a list of events You can edit interpret and retell your story even as youre constrained by the facts footnote footnote I met a young man named Emeka whod been paralyzed playing football After his injury Emeka told himself My life was great playing football but now look at me People who tell stories like this  My life was good Now its bad  tend to be more anxious and depressed And that was Emeka for a while But with time he started to weave a different story His new story was Before my injury my life was purposeless I partied a lot and was a pretty selfish guy But my injury made me realize I could be a better man That edit to his story changed Emekas life After telling the new story to himself Emeka started mentoring kids and he discovered what his purpose was serving others The psychologist Dan McAdams calls this a redemptive story where the bad is redeemed by the good People leading meaningful lives hes found tend to tell stories about their lives defined by redemption growth and love But what makes people change their stories Some people get help from a therapist but you can do it on your own too just by reflecting on your life thoughtfully how your defining experiences shaped you what you lost what you gained Thats what Emeka did You wont change your story overnight it could take years and be painful After all weve all suffered and we all struggle But embracing those painful memories can lead to new insights and wisdom to finding that good that sustains you Belonging purpose transcendence storytelling those are the four pillars of meaning When I was younger I was lucky enough to be surrounded by all of the pillars My parents ran a Sufi meetinghouse from our home in Montreal Sufism is a spiritual practice associated with the whirling dervishes and the poet Rumi Twice a week Sufis would come to our home to meditate drink Persian tea and share stories Their practice also involved serving all of creation through small acts of love which meant being kind even when people wronged you But it gave them a purpose to rein in the ego Eventually I left home for college and without the daily grounding of Sufism in my life I felt unmoored And I started searching for those things that make life worth living Thats what set me on this journey Looking back I now realize that the Sufi house had a real culture of meaning The pillars were part of the architecture and the presence of the pillars helped us all live more deeply Of course the same principle applies in other strong communities as well  good ones and bad ones Gangs cults these are cultures of meaning that use the pillars and give people something to live and die for But thats exactly why we as a society must offer better alternatives We need to build these pillars within our families and our institutions to help people become their best selves But living a meaningful life takes work Its an ongoing process As each day goes by were constantly creating our lives adding to our story And sometimes we can get off track Whenever that happens to me I remember a powerful experience I had with my father Several months after I graduated from college my dad had a massive heart attack that should have killed him He survived and when I asked him what was going through his mind as he faced death he said all he could think about was needing to live so he could be there for my brother and me and this gave him the will to fight for life When he went under anesthesia for emergency surgery instead of counting backwards from 10 he repeated our names like a mantra He wanted our names to be the last words he spoke on earth if he died My dad is a carpenter and a Sufi Its a humble life but a good life Lying there facing death he had a reason to live love His sense of belonging within his family his purpose as a dad his transcendent meditation repeating our names  these he says are the reasons why he survived Thats the story he tells himself Thats the power of meaning Happiness comes and goes But when life is really good and when things are really bad having meaning gives you something to hold on to Thank youI grew up with my identical twin who was an incredibly loving brother Now one thing about being a twin is it makes you an expert at spotting favoritism If his cookie was even slightly bigger than my cookie I had questions And clearly I wasnt starving When I became a psychologist I began to notice favoritism of a different kind and that is how much more we value the body than we do the mind I spent nine years at university earning my doctorate in psychology and I cant tell you how many people look at my business card and say Oh  a psychologist So not a real doctor as if it should say that on my card Dr Guy Winch Just a Psychologist  This favoritism we show the body over the mind  I see it everywhere I recently was at a friends house and their fiveyearold was getting ready for bed He was standing on a stool by the sink brushing his teeth when he slipped and scratched his leg on the stool when he fell He cried for a minute but then he got back up got back on the stool and reached out for a box of BandAids to put one on his cut Now this kid could barely tie his shoelaces but he knew you have to cover a cut so it doesnt become infected and you have to care for your teeth by brushing twice a day We all know how to maintain our physical health and how to practice dental hygiene right Weve known it since we were five years old But what do we know about maintaining our psychological health Well nothing What do we teach our children about emotional hygiene Nothing How is it that we spend more time taking care of our teeth than we do our minds Why is it that our physical health is so much more important to us than our psychological health We sustain psychological injuries even more often than we do physical ones injuries like failure or rejection or loneliness And they can also get worse if we ignore them and they can impact our lives in dramatic ways And yet even though there are scientifically proven techniques we could use to treat these kinds of psychological injuries we dont It doesnt even occur to us that we should Oh youre feeling depressed Just shake it off its all in your head Can you imagine saying that to somebody with a broken leg Oh just walk it off its all in your leg It is time we closed the gap between our physical and our psychological health Its time we made them more equal more like twins Speaking of which my brother is also a psychologist So hes not a real doctor either We didnt study together though In fact the hardest thing Ive ever done in my life is move across the Atlantic to New York City to get my doctorate in psychology We were apart then for the first time in our lives and the separation was brutal for both of us But while he remained among family and friends I was alone in a new country We missed each other terribly but international phone calls were really expensive then and we could only afford to speak for five minutes a week When our birthday rolled around it was the first we wouldnt be spending together We decided to splurge and that week we would talk for 10 minutes I spent the morning pacing around my room waiting for him to call  and waiting  and waiting But the phone didnt ring Given the time difference I assumed OK hes out with friends hell call later There were no cell phones then But he didnt And I began to realize that after being away for over 10 months he no longer missed me the way I missed him I knew he would call in the morning but that night was one of the saddest and longest nights of my life I woke up the next morning I glanced down at the phone and I realized I had kicked it off the hook when pacing the day before I stumbled out of bed I put the phone back on the receiver and it rang a second later And it was my brother and boy was he pissed It was the saddest and longest night of his life as well Now I tried to explain what happened but he said I dont understand If you saw I wasnt calling you why didnt you just pick up the phone and call me He was right Why didnt I call him I didnt have an answer then But I do today and its a simple one loneliness footnote footnote Loneliness creates a deep psychological wound one that distorts our perceptions and scrambles our thinking It makes us believe that those around us care much less than they actually do It make us really afraid to reach out because why set yourself up for rejection and heartache when your heart is already aching more than you can stand I was in the grips of real loneliness back then but I was surrounded by people all day so it never occurred to me But loneliness is defined purely subjectively It depends solely on whether you feel emotionally or socially disconnected from those around you And I did There is a lot of research on loneliness and all of it is horrifying Loneliness wont just make you miserable it will kill you Im not kidding Chronic loneliness increases your likelihood of an early death by 14 percent Fourteen percent Loneliness causes high blood pressure high cholesterol It even suppress the functioning of your immune system making you vulnerable to all kinds of illnesses and diseases In fact scientists have concluded that taken together chronic loneliness poses as significant a risk for your longterm health and longevity as cigarette smoking Now cigarette packs come with warnings saying This could kill you But loneliness doesnt And thats why its so important that we prioritize our psychological health that we practice emotional hygiene Because you cant treat a psychological wound if you dont even know youre injured Loneliness isnt the only psychological wound that distorts our perceptions and misleads us footnote footnote Failure does that as well I once visited a day care center where I saw three toddlers play with identical plastic toys You had to slide the red button and a cute doggie would pop out One little girl tried pulling the purple button then pushing it and then she just sat back and looked at the box with her lower lip trembling The little boy next to her watched this happen then turned to his box and burst into tears without even touching it Meanwhile another little girl tried everything she could think of until she slid the red button the cute doggie popped out and she squealed with delight So three toddlers with identical plastic toys but with very different reactions to failure The first two toddlers were perfectly capable of sliding a red button The only thing that prevented them from succeeding was that their mind tricked them into believing they could not Now adults get tricked this way as well all the time In fact we all have a default set of feelings and beliefs that gets triggered whenever we encounter frustrations and setbacks Are you aware of how your mind reacts to failure You need to be Because if your mind tries to convince you youre incapable of something and you believe it then like those two toddlers youll begin to feel helpless and youll stop trying too soon or you wont even try at all And then youll be even more convinced you cant succeed You see thats why so many people function below their actual potential Because somewhere along the way sometimes a single failure convinced them that they couldnt succeed and they believed it Once we become convinced of something its very difficult to change our mind I learned that lesson the hard way when I was a teenager with my brother We were driving with friends down a dark road at night when a police car stopped us There had been a robbery in the area and they were looking for suspects The officer approached the car and shined his flashlight on the driver then on my brother in the front seat and then on me And his eyes opened wide and he said Where have I seen your face before And I said In the front seat But that made no sense to him whatsoever so now he thought I was on drugs So he drags me out of the car he searches me he marches me over to the police car and only when he verified I didnt have a police record could I show him I had a twin in the front seat But even as we were driving away you could see by the look on his face he was convinced that I was getting away with something Our mind is hard to change once we become convinced So it might be very natural to feel demoralized and defeated after you fail But you cannot allow yourself to become convinced you cant succeed You have to fight feelings of helplessness You have to gain control over the situation And you have to break this kind of negative cycle before it begins Stop Emotional Bleeding footnote footnote Our minds and our feelings  theyre not the trustworthy friends we thought they were Theyre more like a really moody friend who can be totally supportive one minute and really unpleasant the next I once worked with this woman who after 20 years marriage and an extremely ugly divorce was finally ready for her first date She had met this guy online and he seemed nice and he seemed successful and most importantly he seemed really into her So she was very excited she bought a new dress and they met at an upscale New York City bar for a drink Ten minutes into the date the man stands up and says Im not interested and walks out Rejection is extremely painful The woman was so hurt she couldnt move All she could do was call a friend Heres what the friend said Well what do you expect You have big hips you have nothing interesting to say Why would a handsome successful man like that ever go out with a loser like you Shocking right that a friend could be so cruel But it would be much less shocking if I told you it wasnt the friend who said that Its what the woman said to herself And thats something we all do especially after a rejection We all start thinking of all our faults and all our shortcomings what we wish we were what we wish we werent We call ourselves names Maybe not as harshly but we all do it And its interesting that we do because our selfesteem is already hurting Why would we want to go and damage it even further We wouldnt make a physical injury worse on purpose You wouldnt get a cut on your arm and decide Oh I know  Im going to take a knife and see how much deeper I can make it footnote footnote But we do that with psychological injuries all the time Why Because of poor emotional hygiene Because we dont prioritize our psychological health We know from dozens of studies that when your selfesteem is lower you are more vulnerable to stress and to anxiety that failures and rejections hurt more and it takes longer to recover from them So when you get rejected the first thing you should be doing is to revive your selfesteem not join Fight Club and beat it into a pulp When youre in emotional pain treat yourself with the same compassion you would expect from a truly good friend Protect Your SelfEsteem footnote footnote We have to catch our unhealthy psychological habits and change them And one of unhealthiest and most common is called rumination To ruminate means to chew over Its when your boss yells at you or your professor makes you feel stupid in class or you have big fight with a friend and you just cant stop replaying the scene in your head for days sometimes for weeks on end Now ruminating about upsetting events in this way can easily become a habit and its a very costly one because by spending so much time focused on upsetting and negative thoughts you are actually putting yourself at significant risk for developing clinical depression alcoholism eating disorders and even cardiovascular disease The problem is the urge to ruminate can feel really strong and really important so its a difficult habit to stop I know this for a fact because a little over a year ago I developed the habit myself You see my twin brother was diagnosed with stage 3 nonHodgkins lymphoma His cancer was extremely aggressive He had visible tumors all over his body And he had to start a harsh course of chemotherapy And I couldnt stop thinking about what he was going through I couldnt stop thinking about how much he was suffering even though he never complained not once He had this incredibly positive attitude His psychological health was amazing I was physically healthy but psychologically I was a mess But I knew what to do Studies tell us that even a twominute distraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate in that moment And so each time I had a worrying upsetting negative thought I forced myself to concentrate on something else until the urge passed And within one week my whole outlook changed and became more positive and more hopeful Battle Negative Thinking Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy my brother had a CAT scan and I was by his side when he got the results All the tumors were gone He still had three more rounds of chemotherapy to go but we knew he would recover This picture was taken two weeks ago By taking action when youre lonely by changing your responses to failure by protecting your selfesteem by battling negative thinking you wont just heal your psychological wounds you will build emotional resilience you will thrive A hundred years ago people began practicing personal hygiene and life expectancy rates rose by over 50 percent in just a matter of decades I believe our quality of life could rise just as dramatically if we all began practicing emotional hygiene Can you imagine what the world would be like if everyone was psychologically healthier If there were less loneliness and less depression If people knew how to overcome failure If they felt better about themselves and more empowered If they were happier and more fulfilled I can because thats the world I want to live in And thats the world my brother wants to live in as well And if you just become informed and change a few simple habits well  thats the world we can all live in Thank you very muchGood morning How are you Good Its been great hasnt it Ive been blown away by the whole thing In fact Im leaving There have been three themes running through the conference which are relevant to what I want to talk about One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that weve had and in all of the people here just the variety of it and the range of it The second is that its put us in a place where we have no idea whats going to happen in terms of the future No idea how this may play out I have an interest in education Actually what I find is everybody has an interest in education Dont you I find this very interesting If youre at a dinner party and you say you work in education  actually youre not often at dinner parties frankly If you work in education youre not asked And youre never asked back curiously Thats strange to me But if you are and you say to somebody you know they say What do you do and you say you work in education you can see the blood run from their face Theyre like Oh my God Why me My one night out all week But if you ask about their education they pin you to the wall because its one of those things that goes deep with people am I right Like religion and money and other things So I have a big interest in education and I think we all do We have a huge vested interest in it partly because its education thats meant to take us into this future that we cant grasp If you think of it children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065 Nobody has a clue despite all the expertise thats been on parade for the past four days what the world will look like in five years time And yet were meant to be educating them for it So the unpredictability I think is extraordinary And the third part of this is that weve all agreed nonetheless on the really extraordinary capacities that children have  their capacities for innovation I mean Sirena last night was a marvel wasnt she Just seeing what she could do And shes exceptional but I think shes not so to speak exceptional in the whole of childhood What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent And my contention is all kids have tremendous talents and we squander them pretty ruthlessly So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy and we should treat it with the same status Thank you That was it by the way Thank you very much So 15 minutes left Well I was born   I heard a great story recently  I love telling it  of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson She was six and she was at the back drawing and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention and in this drawing lesson she did The teacher was fascinated She went over to her and she said What are you drawing And the girl said Im drawing a picture of God And the teacher said But nobody knows what God looks like And the girl said They will in a minute When my son was four in England  actually he was four everywhere to be honest If were being strict about it wherever he went he was four that year He was in the Nativity play Do you remember the story No it was big it was a big story Mel Gibson did the sequel you may have seen it Nativity II But James got the part of Joseph which we were thrilled about We considered this to be one of the lead parts We had the place crammed full of agents in Tshirts James Robinson IS Joseph He didnt have to speak but you know the bit where the three kings come in They come in bearing gifts gold frankincense and myrrh This really happened We were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence because we talked to the little boy afterward and said You OK with that They said Yeah why Was that wrong They just switched The three boys came in fouryearolds with tea towels on their heads They put these boxes down and the first boy said I bring you gold And the second boy said I bring you myrrh And the third boy said Frank sent this What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance If they dont know theyll have a go Am I right Theyre not frightened of being wrong I dont mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative What we do know is if youre not prepared to be wrong youll never come up with anything original  if youre not prepared to be wrong And by the time they get to be adults most kids have lost that capacity They have become frightened of being wrong And we run our companies like this We stigmatize mistakes And were now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities Picasso once said this he said that all children are born artists The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up I believe this passionately that we dont grow into creativity we grow out of it Or rather we get educated out of it So why is this I lived in StratfordonAvon until about five years ago In fact we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles So you can imagine what a seamless transition this was Actually we lived in a place called Snitterfield just outside Stratford which is where Shakespeares father was born Are you struck by a new thought I was You dont think of Shakespeare having a father do you Do you Because you dont think of Shakespeare being a child do you Shakespeare being seven I never thought of it I mean he was seven at some point He was in somebodys English class wasnt he How annoying would that be Must try harder Being sent to bed by his dad to Shakespeare Go to bed now To William Shakespeare And put the pencil down And stop speaking like that Its confusing everybody Anyway we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles and I just want to say a word about the transition Actually my son didnt want to come Ive got two kids hes 21 now my daughters 16 He didnt want to come to Los Angeles He loved it but he had a girlfriend in England This was the love of his life Sarah Hed known her for a month Mind you theyd had their fourth anniversary because its a long time when youre 16 He was really upset on the plane He said Ill never find another girl like Sarah And we were rather pleased about that frankly  because she was the main reason we were leaving the country But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects Every one Doesnt matter where you go Youd think it would be otherwise but it isnt At the top are mathematics and languages then the humanities At the bottom are the arts Everywhere on earth And in pretty much every system too theres a hierarchy within the arts Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance There isnt an education system on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics Why Why not I think this is rather important I think math is very important but so is dance Children dance all the time if theyre allowed to we all do We all have bodies dont we Did I miss a meeting Truthfully what happens is as children grow up we start to educate them progressively from the waist up And then we focus on their heads And slightly to one side If you were to visit education as an alien and say Whats it for public education I think youd have to conclude if you look at the output who really succeeds by this who does everything they should who gets all the brownie points who are the winners  I think youd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors Isnt it Theyre the people who come out the top And I used to be one so there And I like university professors but you know we shouldnt hold them up as the highwater mark of all human achievement Theyre just a form of life Another form of life But theyre rather curious And I say this out of affection for them theres something curious about professors In my experience  not all of them but typically  they live in their heads They live up there and slightly to one side Theyre disembodied you know in a kind of literal way They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads Dont they Its a way of getting their head to meetings If you want real evidence of outofbody experiences by the way get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics and pop into the discotheque on the final night And there you will see it Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably off the beat Waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability And theres a reason Around the world there were no public systems of education really before the 19th century They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas Number one that the most useful subjects for work are at the top So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid things you liked on the grounds you would never get a job doing that Is that right Dont do music youre not going to be a musician dont do art you wont be an artist Benign advice  now profoundly mistaken The whole world is engulfed in a revolution And the second is academic ability which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence because the universities design the system in their image If you think of it the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance And the consequence is that many highly talented brilliant creative people think theyre not because the thing they were good at at school wasnt valued or was actually stigmatized And I think we cant afford to go on that way In the next 30 years according to UNESCO more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history More people And its the combination of all the things weve talked about technology and its transformational effect on work and demography and the huge explosion in population Suddenly degrees arent worth anything Isnt that true When I was a student if you had a degree you had a job If you didnt have a job its because you didnt want one And I didnt want one frankly But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA and now you need a PhD for the other Its a process of academic inflation And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence We know three things about intelligence One its diverse We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it We think visually we think in sound we think kinesthetically We think in abstract terms we think in movement Secondly intelligence is dynamic If you look at the interactions of a human brain as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations intelligence is wonderfully interactive The brain isnt divided into compartments In fact creativity  which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value  more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things By the way theres a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum Its thicker in women Following off from Helen yesterday this is probably why women are better at multitasking Because you are arent you Theres a raft of research but I know it from my personal life If my wife is cooking a meal at home which is not often  thankfully No shes good at some things But if shes cooking shes dealing with people on the phone shes talking to the kids shes painting the ceiling  shes doing openheart surgery over here If Im cooking the door is shut the kids are out the phones on the hook if she comes in I get annoyed I say Terry please Im trying to fry an egg in here Give me a break Actually do you know that old philosophical thing If a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it did it happen Remember that old chestnut I saw a great Tshirt recently which said If a man speaks his mind in a forest and no woman hears him is he still wrong And the third thing about intelligence is its distinct Im doing a new book at the moment called Epiphany which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent Im fascinated by how people got to be there Its really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of Gillian Lynne Have you heard of her Some have Shes a choreographer and everybody knows her work She did Cats and Phantom of the Opera Shes wonderful I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet as you can see Gillian and I had lunch one day I said How did you get to be a dancer It was interesting When she was at school she was really hopeless And the school in the 30s wrote to her parents and said We think Gillian has a learning disorder She couldnt concentrate she was fidgeting I think now theyd say she had ADHD Wouldnt you But this was the 1930s and ADHD hadnt been invented at this point It wasnt an available condition People werent aware they could have that Anyway she went to see this specialist So this oakpaneled room and she was there with her mother and she was led and sat on this chair at the end and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother about all the problems Gillian was having at school because she was disturbing people her homework was always late and so on Little kid of eight In the end the doctor went and sat next to Gillian and said Ive listened to all these things your mothers told me I need to speak to her privately Wait here Well be back We wont be very long and they went and left her But as they went out of the room he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk And when they got out of the room he said to her mother Just stand and watch her And the minute they left the room she was on her feet moving to the music And they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said Mrs Lynne Gillian isnt sick Shes a dancer Take her to a dance school I said What happened She said She did I cant tell you how wonderful it was We walked in this room and it was full of people like me  people who couldnt sit still people who had to move to think Who had to move to think They did ballet they did tap jazz they did modern they did contemporary She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School She became a soloist she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company met Andrew Lloyd Webber Shes been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history shes given pleasure to millions and shes a multimillionaire Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down What I think it comes to is this Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we stripmine the earth for a particular commodity And for the future it wont serve us We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which were educating our children There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk who said If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth within 50 years all life on Earth would end If all human beings disappeared from the Earth within 50 years all forms of life would flourish And hes right What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that weve talked about And the only way well do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are And our task is to educate their whole being so they can face this future By the way  we may not see this future but they will And our job is to help them make something of it Thank you very muchSo I want to start by offering you a free notech life hack and all it requires of you is this that you change your posture for two minutes But before I give it away I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what youre doing with your body So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller Maybe youre hunching crossing your legs maybe wrapping your ankles Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this Sometimes we spread out I see you So I want you to pay attention to what youre doing right now Were going to come back to that in a few minutes and Im hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit it could significantly change the way your life unfolds So were really fascinated with body language and were particularly interested in other peoples body language You know were interested in like you know — — an awkward interaction or a smile or a contemptuous glance or maybe a very awkward wink or maybe even something like a handshake Narrator Here they are arriving at Number 10 This lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the President of the United States Here comes the Prime Minister  No Amy Cuddy So a handshake or the lack of a handshake can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks Even the BBC and The New York Times So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior or body language  but we call it nonverbals as social scientists  its language so we think about communication When we think about communication we think about interactions So what is your body language communicating to me Whats mine communicating to you And theres a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this So social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of our body language or other peoples body language on judgments And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote who we ask out on a date For example Nalini Ambady a researcher at Tufts University shows that when people watch 30second soundless clips of real physicianpatient interactions their judgments of the physicians niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued So it doesnt have to do so much with whether or not that physician was incompetent but do we like that person and how they interacted Even more dramatic Alex Todorov at Princeton has shown us that judgments of political candidates faces in just one second predict 70 percent of US Senate and gubernatorial race outcomes and even lets go digital emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead you to claim more value from that negotiation If you use them poorly bad idea Right So when we think of nonverbals we think of how we judge others how they judge us and what the outcomes are We tend to forget though the other audience thats influenced by our nonverbals and thats ourselves We are also influenced by our nonverbals our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology So what nonverbals am I talking about Im a social psychologist I study prejudice and I teach at a competitive business school so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance Well this is what they are So in the animal kingdom they are about expanding So you make yourself big you stretch out you take up space youre basically opening up Its about opening up And this is true across the animal kingdom Its not just limited to primates And humans do the same thing So they do this both when they have power sort of chronically and also when theyre feeling powerful in the moment And this one is especially interesting because it really shows us how universal and old these expressions of power are This expression which is known as pride Jessica Tracy has studied She shows that people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind do this when they win at a physical competition So when they cross the finish line and theyve won it doesnt matter if theyve never seen anyone do it They do this So the arms up in the V the chin is slightly lifted What do we do when we feel powerless We do exactly the opposite We close up We wrap ourselves up We make ourselves small We dont want to bump into the person next to us So again both animals and humans do the same thing And this is what happens when you put together high and low power So what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the others nonverbals So if someone is being really powerful with us we tend to make ourselves smaller We dont mirror them We do the opposite of them So Im watching this behavior in the classroom and what do I notice I notice that MBA students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbals So you have people who are like caricatures of alphas really coming into the room they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts like they really want to occupy space When they sit down theyre sort of spread out They raise their hands like this You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in As soon they come in you see it You see it on their faces and their bodies and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny and they go like this when they raise their hand I notice a couple of things about this One youre not going to be surprised It seems to be related to gender So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men Women feel chronically less powerful than men so this is not surprising But the other thing I noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating and how well they were participating And this is really important in the MBA classroom because participation counts for half the grade So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap You get these equally qualified women and men coming in and then you get these differences in grades and it seems to be partly attributable to participation So I started to wonder you know okay so you have these people coming in like this and theyre participating Is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more So my main collaborator Dana Carney whos at Berkeley and I really wanted to know can you fake it till you make it Like can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful So we know that our nonverbals govern how other people think and feel about us Theres a lot of evidence But our question really was do our nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves Theres some evidence that they do So for example we smile when we feel happy but also when were forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this it makes us feel happy So it goes both ways When it comes to power it also goes both ways So when you feel powerful youre more likely to do this but its also possible that when you pretend to be powerful you are more likely to actually feel powerful So the second question really was you know so we know that our minds change our bodies but is it also true that our bodies change our minds And when I say minds in the case of the powerful what am I talking about So Im talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings and in my case thats hormones I look at hormones So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like So powerful people tend to be not surprisingly more assertive and more confident more optimistic They actually feel theyre going to win even at games of chance They also tend to be able to think more abstractly So there are a lot of differences They take more risks There are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people Physiologically there also are differences on two key hormones testosterone which is the dominance hormone and cortisol which is the stress hormone So what we find is that highpower alpha males in primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol and powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low cortisol So what does that mean When you think about power people tended to think only about testosterone because that was about dominance But really power is also about how you react to stress So do you want the highpower leader thats dominant high on testosterone but really stress reactive Probably not right You want the person whos powerful and assertive and dominant but not very stress reactive the person whos laid back So we know that in primate hierarchies if an alpha needs to take over if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly within a few days that individuals testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly So we have this evidence both that the body can shape the mind at least at the facial level and also that role changes can shape the mind So what happens okay you take a role change what happens if you do that at a really minimal level like this tiny manipulation this tiny intervention For two minutes you say I want you to stand like this and its going to make you feel more powerful So this is what we did We decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment and these people adopted for two minutes either highpower poses or lowpower poses and Im just going to show you five of the poses although they took on only two So heres one A couple more This one has been dubbed the Wonder Woman by the media Here are a couple more So you can be standing or you can be sitting And here are the lowpower poses So youre folding up youre making yourself small This one is very lowpower When youre touching your neck youre really protecting yourself So this is what happens They come in they spit into a vial for two minutes we say You need to do this or this They dont look at pictures of the poses We dont want to prime them with a concept of power We want them to be feeling power So two minutes they do this We then ask them How powerful do you feel on a series of items and then we give them an opportunity to gamble and then we take another saliva sample Thats it Thats the whole experiment So this is what we find Risk tolerance which is the gambling we find that when you are in the highpower pose condition 86 percent of you will gamble When youre in the lowpower pose condition only 60 percent and thats a whopping significant difference Heres what we find on testosterone From their baseline when they come in highpower people experience about a 20percent increase and lowpower people experience about a 10percent decrease So again two minutes and you get these changes Heres what you get on cortisol Highpower people experience about a 25percent decrease and the lowpower people experience about a 15percent increase So two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive confident and comfortable or really stressreactive and feeling sort of shut down And weve all had the feeling right So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves so its not just others but its also ourselves Also our bodies change our minds But the next question of course is can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways This is in the lab its this little task its just a couple of minutes Where can you actually apply this Which we cared about of course And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations like social threat situations Where are you being evaluated either by your friends For teenagers its at the lunchroom table For some people its speaking at a school board meeting It might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview We decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through was the job interview So we published these findings and the media are all over it and they say Okay so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview right You know so we were of course horrified and said Oh my God no thats not what we meant at all For numerous reasons no dont do that Again this is not about you talking to other people Its you talking to yourself What do you do before you go into a job interview You do this Youre sitting down Youre looking at your iPhone  or your Android not trying to leave anyone out Youre looking at your notes youre hunching up making yourself small when really what you should be doing maybe is this like in the bathroom right Do that Find two minutes So thats what we want to test Okay So we bring people into a lab and they do either high or lowpower poses again they go through a very stressful job interview Its five minutes long They are being recorded Theyre being judged also and the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback so they look like this Imagine this is the person interviewing you So for five minutes nothing and this is worse than being heckled People hate this Its what Marianne LaFrance calls standing in social quicksand So this really spikes your cortisol So this is the job interview we put them through because we really wanted to see what happened We then have these coders look at these tapes four of them Theyre blind to the hypothesis Theyre blind to the conditions They have no idea whos been posing in what pose and they end up looking at these sets of tapes and they say We want to hire these people all the highpower posers We dont want to hire these people We also evaluate these people much more positively overall But whats driving it Its not about the content of the speech Its about the presence that theyre bringing to the speech Because we rate them on all these variables related to competence like how wellstructured is the speech How good is it What are their qualifications No effect on those things This is whats affected These kinds of things People are bringing their true selves basically Theyre bringing themselves They bring their ideas but as themselves with no you know residue over them So this is whats driving the effect or mediating the effect So when I tell people about this that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior and our behavior can change our outcomes they say to me It feels fake Right So I said fake it till you make it Its not me I dont want to get there and then still feel like a fraud I dont want to feel like an impostor I dont want to get there only to feel like Im not supposed to be here And that really resonated with me because I want to tell you a little story about being an impostor and feeling like Im not supposed to be here When I was 19 I was in a really bad car accident I was thrown out of a car rolled several times I was thrown from the car And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward and I had been withdrawn from college and I learned that my IQ had dropped by two standard deviations which was very traumatic I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart and I had been called gifted as a child So Im taken out of college I keep trying to go back They say Youre not going to finish college Just you know there are other things for you to do but thats not going to work out for you So I really struggled with this and I have to say having your identity taken from you your core identity and for me it was being smart having that taken from you theres nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that So I felt entirely powerless I worked and worked and I got lucky and worked and got lucky and worked Eventually I graduated from college It took me four years longer than my peers and I convinced someone my angel advisor Susan Fiske to take me on and so I ended up at Princeton and I was like I am not supposed to be here I am an impostor And the night before my firstyear talk and the firstyear talk at Princeton is a 20minute talk to 20 people Thats it I was so afraid of being found out the next day that I called her and said Im quitting She was like You are not quitting because I took a gamble on you and youre staying Youre going to stay and this is what youre going to do You are going to fake it Youre going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do Youre just going to do it and do it and do it even if youre terrified and just paralyzed and having an outofbody experience until you have this moment where you say Oh my gosh Im doing it Like I have become this I am actually doing this So thats what I did Five years in grad school a few years you know Im at Northwestern I moved to Harvard Im at Harvard Im not really thinking about it anymore but for a long time I had been thinking Not supposed to be here So at the end of my first year at Harvard a student who had not talked in class the entire semester who I had said Look youve gotta participate or else youre going to fail came into my office I really didnt know her at all She came in totally defeated and she said Im not supposed to be here And that was the moment for me Because two things happened One was that I realized oh my gosh I dont feel like that anymore I dont feel that anymore but she does and I get that feeling And the second was she is supposed to be here Like she can fake it she can become it So I was like Yes you are You are supposed to be here And tomorrow youre going to fake it youre going to make yourself powerful and you know  And youre going to go into the classroom and you are going to give the best comment ever You know And she gave the best comment ever and people turned around and were like oh my God I didnt even notice her sitting there She comes back to me months later and I realized that she had not just faked it till she made it she had actually faked it till she became it So she had changed And so I want to say to you dont fake it till you make it Fake it till you become it Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize The last thing Im going to leave you with is this Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes So this is two minutes Two minutes two minutes two minutes Before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation for two minutes try doing this in the elevator in a bathroom stall at your desk behind closed doors Thats what you want to do Configure your brain to cope the best in that situation Get your testosterone up Get your cortisol down Dont leave that situation feeling like oh I didnt show them who I am Leave that situation feeling like I really feel like I got to say who I am and show who I am So I want to ask you first you know both to try power posing and also I want to ask you to share the science because this is simple I dont have ego involved in this Give it away Share it with people because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power Give it to them because they can do it in private They need their bodies privacy and two minutes and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life Thank youSo Ill start with this a couple years ago an event planner called me because I was going to do a speaking event And she called and she said Im really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer And I thought Well whats the struggle And she said Well I saw you speak and Im going to call you a researcher I think but Im afraid if I call you a researcher no one will come because theyll think youre boring and irrelevant And I was like Okay And she said But the thing I liked about your talk is youre a storyteller So I think what Ill do is just call you a storyteller And of course the academic insecure part of me was like Youre going to call me a what And she said Im going to call you a storyteller And I was like Why not magic pixie I was like Let me think about this for a second I tried to call deep on my courage And I thought you know I am a storyteller Im a qualitative researcher I collect stories thats what I do And maybe stories are just data with a soul And maybe Im just a storyteller And so I said You know what Why dont you just say Im a researcherstoryteller And she went Ha ha Theres no such thing So Im a researcherstoryteller and Im going to talk to you today  were talking about expanding perception  and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that I live and love and work and parent And this is where my story starts When I was a young researcher doctoral student my first year I had a research professor who said to us Heres the thing if you cannot measure it it does not exist And I thought he was just sweettalking me I was like Really and he was like Absolutely And so you have to understand that I have a bachelors and a masters in social work and I was getting my PhD in social work so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the lifes messy love it And Im more of the lifes messy clean it up organize it and put it into a bento box And so to think that I had found my way to found a career that takes me  really one of the big sayings in social work is Lean into the discomfort of the work And Im like knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all As That was my mantra So I was very excited about this And so I thought you know what this is the career for me because I am interested in some messy topics But I want to be able to make them not messy I want to understand them I want to hack into these things that I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see So where I started was with connection Because by the time youre a social worker for 10 years what you realize is that connection is why were here Its what gives purpose and meaning to our lives This is what its all about It doesnt matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice mental health and abuse and neglect what we know is that connection the ability to feel connected is  neurobiologically thats how were wired  its why were here So I thought you know what Im going to start with connection Well you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss and she tells you 37 things that you do really awesome and one opportunity for growth And all you can think about is that opportunity for growth right Well apparently this is the way my work went as well because when you ask people about love they tell you about heartbreak When you ask people about belonging theyll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded And when you ask people about connection the stories they told me were about disconnection So very quickly  really about six weeks into this research  I ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that I didnt understand or had never seen And so I pulled back out of the research and thought I need to figure out what this is And it turned out to be shame And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection Is there something about me that if other people know it or see it that I wont be worthy of connection The things I can tell you about it Its universal we all have it The only people who dont experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection No one wants to talk about it and the less you talk about it the more you have it What underpinned this shame this Im not good enough  which we all know that feeling Im not blank enough Im not thin enough rich enough beautiful enough smart enough promoted enough The thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability This idea of in order for connection to happen we have to allow ourselves to be seen really seen And you know how I feel about vulnerability I hate vulnerability And so I thought this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick Im going in Im going to figure this stuff out Im going to spend a year Im going to totally deconstruct shame Im going to understand how vulnerability works and Im going to outsmart it So I was ready and I was really excited As you know its not going to turn out well You know this So I could tell you a lot about shame but Id have to borrow everyone elses time But heres what I can tell you that it boils down to  and this may be one of the most important things that Ive ever learned in the decade of doing this research My one year turned into six years Thousands of stories hundreds of long interviews focus groups At one point people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories  thousands of pieces of data in six years And I kind of got a handle on it I kind of understood this is what shame is this is how it works I wrote a book I published a theory but something was not okay  and what it was is that if I roughly took the people I interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness  thats what this comes down to a sense of worthiness  they have a strong sense of love and belonging  and folks who struggle for it and folks who are always wondering if theyre good enough There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it And that was the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe theyre worthy of love and belonging Thats it They believe theyre worthy And to me the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that were not worthy of connection was something that personally and professionally I felt like I needed to understand better So what I did is I took all of the interviews where I saw worthiness where I saw people living that way and just looked at those What do these people have in common I have a slight office supply addiction but thats another talk So I had a manila folder and I had a Sharpie and I was like what am I going to call this research And the first words that came to my mind were wholehearted These are wholehearted people living from this deep sense of worthiness So I wrote at the top of the manila folder and I started looking at the data In fact I did it first in a fourday very intensive data analysis where I went back pulled the interviews the stories pulled the incidents Whats the theme Whats the pattern My husband left town with the kids because I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing where Im just writing and in my researcher mode And so heres what I found What they had in common was a sense of courage And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute Courage the original definition of courage when it first came into the English language  its from the Latin word cor meaning heart  and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart And so these folks had very simply the courage to be imperfect They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others because as it turns out we cant practice compassion with other people if we cant treat ourselves kindly And the last was they had connection and  this was the hard part  as a result of authenticity they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were which you have to absolutely do that for connection The other thing that they had in common was this They fully embraced vulnerability They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful They didnt talk about vulnerability being comfortable nor did they really talk about it being excruciating  as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing They just talked about it being necessary They talked about the willingness to say I love you first  the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees  the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram Theyre willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out They thought this was fundamental I personally thought it was betrayal I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research where our job  you know the definition of research is to control and predict to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict And now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting This led to a little breakdown   which actually looked more like this And it did I call it a breakdown my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening A spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown but I assure you it was a breakdown And I had to put my data away and go find a therapist Let me tell you something you know who you are when you call your friends and say I think I need to see somebody Do you have any recommendations Because about five of my friends were like Wooo I wouldnt want to be your therapist I was like What does that mean And theyre like Im just saying you know Dont bring your measuring stick I was like Okay So I found a therapist My first meeting with her Diana  I brought in my list of the way the wholehearted live and I sat down And she said How are you And I said Im great Im okay She said Whats going on And this is a therapist who sees therapists because we have to go to those because their BS meters are good And so I said Heres the thing Im struggling And she said Whats the struggle And I said Well I have a vulnerability issue And I know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness but it appears that its also the birthplace of joy of creativity of belonging of love And I think I have a problem and I need some help And I said But heres the thing no family stuff no childhood shit I just need some strategies Thank you So she goes like this And then I said Its bad right And she said Its neither good nor bad It just is what it is And I said Oh my God this is going to suck And it did and it didnt And it took about a year And you know how there are people that when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important that they surrender and walk into it A thats not me and B I dont even hang out with people like that For me it was a yearlong street fight It was a slugfest Vulnerability pushed I pushed back I lost the fight but probably won my life back And so then I went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they the wholehearted what choices they were making and what we are doing with vulnerability Why do we struggle with it so much Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability No So this is what I learned We numb vulnerability  when were waiting for the call It was funny I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook that says How would you define vulnerability What makes you feel vulnerable And within an hour and a half I had 150 responses Because I wanted to know whats out there Having to ask my husband for help because Im sick and were newly married initiating sex with my husband initiating sex with my wife being turned down asking someone out waiting for the doctor to call back getting laid off laying off people This is the world we live in We live in a vulnerable world And one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability And I think theres evidence  and its not the only reason this evidence exists but I think its a huge cause  We are the most indebt  obese  addicted and medicated adult cohort in US history The problem is  and I learned this from the research  that you cannot selectively numb emotion You cant say heres the bad stuff Heres vulnerability heres grief heres shame heres fear heres disappointment I dont want to feel these Im going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin I dont want to feel these And I know thats knowing laughter I hack into your lives for a living God You cant numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects our emotions You cannot selectively numb So when we numb those we numb joy we numb gratitude we numb happiness And then we are miserable and we are looking for purpose and meaning and then we feel vulnerable so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin And it becomes this dangerous cycle One of the things that I think we need to think about is why and how we numb And it doesnt just have to be addiction The other thing we do is we make everything thats uncertain certain Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty Im right youre wrong Shut up Thats it Just certain The more afraid we are the more vulnerable we are the more afraid we are This is what politics looks like today Theres no discourse anymore Theres no conversation Theres just blame You know how blame is described in the research A way to discharge pain and discomfort We perfect If theres anyone who wants their life to look like this it would be me but it doesnt work Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks Which just I hope in 100 years people will look back and go Wow And we perfect most dangerously our children Let me tell you what we think about children Theyre hardwired for struggle when they get here And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand our job is not to say Look at her shes perfect My job is just to keep her perfect  make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh Thats not our job Our job is to look and say You know what Youre imperfect and youre wired for struggle but you are worthy of love and belonging Thats our job Show me a generation of kids raised like that and well end the problems I think that we see today We pretend that what we do doesnt have an effect on people We do that in our personal lives We do that corporate  whether its a bailout an oil spill  a recall We pretend like what were doing doesnt have a huge impact on other people I would say to companies this is not our first rodeo people We just need you to be authentic and real and say  Were sorry Well fix it But theres another way and Ill leave you with this This is what I have found To let ourselves be seen deeply seen vulnerably seen  to love with our whole hearts even though theres no guarantee  and thats really hard and I can tell you as a parent thats excruciatingly difficult  to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror when were wondering Can I love you this much Can I believe in this this passionately Can I be this fierce about this just to be able to stop and instead of catastrophizing what might happen to say Im just so grateful because to feel this vulnerable means Im alive And the last which I think is probably the most important is to believe that were enough Because when we work from a place I believe that says Im enough  then we stop screaming and start listening were kinder and gentler to the people around us and were kinder and gentler to ourselves Thats all I have Thank youHow do you explain when things dont go as we assume Or better how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions For example Why is Apple so innovative Year after year after year theyre more innovative than all their competition And yet theyre just a computer company Theyre just like everyone else They have the same access to the same talent the same agencies the same consultants the same media Then why is it that they seem to have something different Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement He wasnt the only man who suffered in precivil rights America and he certainly wasnt the only great orator of the day Why him And why is it that the Wright brothers were able to figure out controlled powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified better funded  and they didnt achieve powered man flight and the Wright brothers beat them to it Theres something else at play here About three and a half years ago I made a discovery And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it As it turns out theres a pattern As it turns out all the great inspiring leaders and organizations in the world whether its Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers they all think act and communicate the exact same way And its the complete opposite to everyone else All I did was codify it and its probably the worlds simplest idea I call it the golden circle Why How What This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others arent Let me define the terms really quickly Every single person every single organization on the planet knows what they do 100 percent Some know how they do it whether you call it your differentiated value proposition or your proprietary process or your USP But very very few people or organizations know why they do what they do And by why I dont mean to make a profit Thats a result Its always a result By why I mean Whats your purpose Whats your cause Whats your belief Why does your organization exist Why do you get out of bed in the morning And why should anyone care As a result the way we think we act the way we communicate is from the outside in its obvious We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing But the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations  regardless of their size regardless of their industry  all think act and communicate from the inside out Let me give you an example I use Apple because theyre easy to understand and everybody gets it If Apple were like everyone else a marketing message from them might sound like this We make great computers Theyre beautifully designed simple to use and user friendly Want to buy one Meh Thats how most of us communicate Thats how most marketing and sales are done thats how we communicate interpersonally We say what we do we say how were different or better and we expect some sort of a behavior a purchase a vote something like that Heres our new law firm We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients we always perform for our clients Heres our new car It gets great gas mileage it has leather seats Buy our car But its uninspiring Heres how Apple actually communicates Everything we do we believe in challenging the status quo We believe in thinking differently The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed simple to use and user friendly We just happen to make great computers Want to buy one Totally different right Youre ready to buy a computer from me I just reversed the order of the information What it proves to us is that people dont buy what you do people buy why you do it This explains why every single person in this room is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple But were also perfectly comfortable buying an MP3 player from Apple or a phone from Apple or a DVR from Apple As I said before Apples just a computer company Nothing distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors Their competitors are equally qualified to make all of these products In fact they tried A few years ago Gateway came out with flatscreen TVs Theyre eminently qualified to make flatscreen TVs Theyve been making flatscreen monitors for years Nobody bought one Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs and they make great quality products and they can make perfectly welldesigned products  and nobody bought one In fact talking about it now we cant even imagine buying an MP3 player from Dell Why would you buy one from a computer company But we do it every day People dont buy what you do they buy why you do it The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe Heres the best part None of what Im telling you is my opinion Its all grounded in the tenets of biology Not psychology biology If you look at a crosssection of the human brain from the top down the human brain is actually broken into three major components that correlate perfectly with the golden circle Our newest brain our Homo sapien brain our neocortex corresponds with the what level The neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language The middle two sections make up our limbic brains and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings like trust and loyalty Its also responsible for all human behavior all decisionmaking and it has no capacity for language In other words when we communicate from the outside in yes people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures It just doesnt drive behavior When we can communicate from the inside out were talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do This is where gut decisions come from Sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures and they say I know what all the facts and details say but it just doesnt feel right Why would we use that verb it doesnt feel right Because the part of the brain that controls decisionmaking doesnt control language The best we can muster up is I dont know It just doesnt feel right Or sometimes you say youre leading with your heart or soul I hate to break it to you those arent other body parts controlling your behavior Its all happening here in your limbic brain the part of the brain that controls decisionmaking and not language But if you dont know why you do what you do and people respond to why you do what you do then how will you ever get people to vote for you or buy something from you or more importantly be loyal and want to be a part of what it is that you do The goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe The goal is not just to hire people who need a job its to hire people who believe what you believe I always say that you know if you hire people just because they can do a job theyll work for your money but if they believe what you believe theyll work for you with blood and sweat and tears Nowhere else is there a better example than with the Wright brothers Most people dont know about Samuel Pierpont Langley And back in the early 20th century the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day Everybody was trying it And Samuel Pierpont Langley had what we assume to be the recipe for success Even now you ask people Why did your product or why did your company fail and people always give you the same permutation of the same three things undercapitalized the wrong people bad market conditions Its always the same three things so lets explore that Samuel Pierpont Langley was given 50000 dollars by the War Department to figure out this flying machine Money was no problem He held a seat at Harvard and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely wellconnected he knew all the big minds of the day He hired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic The New York Times followed him around everywhere and everyone was rooting for Langley Then how come weve never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley A few hundred miles away in Dayton Ohio Orville and Wilbur Wright they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success They had no money they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop Not a single person on the Wright brothers team had a college education not even Orville or Wilbur And The New York Times followed them around nowhere The difference was Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause by a purpose by a belief They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine itll change the course of the world Samuel Pierpont Langley was different He wanted to be rich and he wanted to be famous He was in pursuit of the result He was in pursuit of the riches And lo and behold look what happened The people who believed in the Wright brothers dream worked with them with blood and sweat and tears The others just worked for the paycheck They tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out they would have to take five sets of parts because thats how many times they would crash before supper And eventually on December 17th 1903 the Wright brothers took flight and no one was there to even experience it We found out about it a few days later And further proof that Langley was motivated by the wrong thing the day the Wright brothers took flight he quit He could have said Thats an amazing discovery guys and I will improve upon your technology but he didnt He wasnt first he didnt get rich he didnt get famous so he quit People dont buy what you do they buy why you do it If you talk about what you believe you will attract those who believe what you believe But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe Something called the law of diffusion of innovation if you dont know the law you know the terminology The first 25 of our population are our innovators The next 135 of our population are our early adopters The next 34 are your early majority your late majority and your laggards The only reason these people buy touchtone phones is because you cant buy rotary phones anymore We all sit at various places at various times on this scale but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you want massmarket success or massmarket acceptance of an idea you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point between 15 and 18 percent market penetration and then the system tips I love asking businesses Whats your conversion on new business They love to tell you Its about 10 percent proudly Well you can trip over 10 of the customers We all have about 10 who just get it Thats how we describe them right Thats like that gut feeling Oh they just get it The problem is How do you find the ones that get it before doing business versus the ones who dont get it So its this here this little gap that you have to close as Jeffrey Moore calls it Crossing the Chasm  because you see the early majority will not try something until someone else has tried it first And these guys the innovators and the early adopters theyre comfortable making those gut decisions Theyre more comfortable making those intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available These are the people who stood in line for six hours to buy an iPhone when they first came out when you could have bought one off the shelf the next week These are the people who spent 40000 dollars on flatscreen TVs when they first came out even though the technology was substandard And by the way they didnt do it because the technology was so great they did it for themselves Its because they wanted to be first People dont buy what you do they buy why you do it and what you do simply proves what you believe In fact people will do the things that prove what they believe The reason that person bought the iPhone in the first six hours stood in line for six hours was because of what they believed about the world and how they wanted everybody to see them they were first People dont buy what you do they buy why you do it So let me give you a famous example a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation First the famous failure Its a commercial example As we said before the recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions You should have success then Look at TiVo From the time TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago to this current day they are the single highestquality product on the market hands down there is no dispute They were extremely wellfunded Market conditions were fantastic I mean we use TiVo as verb I TiVo stuff on my pieceofjunk Time Warner DVR all the time But TiVos a commercial failure Theyve never made money And when they went IPO their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted and its never traded above 10 In fact I dont think its even traded above six except for a couple of little spikes Because you see when TiVo launched their product they told us all what they had They said We have a product that pauses live TV skips commercials rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking And the cynical majority said We dont believe you We dont need it We dont like it Youre scaring us What if they had said If youre the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life boy do we have a product for you It pauses live TV skips commercials memorizes your viewing habits etc etc People dont buy what you do they buy why you do it and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe Now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation In the summer of 1963 250000 people showed up on the mall in Washington to hear Dr King speak They sent out no invitations and there was no website to check the date How do you do that Well Dr King wasnt the only man in America who was a great orator He wasnt the only man in America who suffered in a precivil rights America In fact some of his ideas were bad But he had a gift He didnt go around telling people what needed to change in America He went around and told people what he believed I believe I believe I believe he told people And people who believed what he believed took his cause and they made it their own and they told people And some of those people created structures to get the word out to even more people And lo and behold 250000 people showed up on the right day at the right time to hear him speak How many of them showed up for him Zero They showed up for themselves Its what they believed about America that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August Its what they believed and it wasnt about black versus white 25 of the audience was white Dr King believed that there are two types of laws in this world those that are made by a higher authority and those that are made by men And not until all the laws that are made by men are consistent with the laws made by the higher authority will we live in a just world It just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life We followed not for him but for ourselves By the way he gave the I have a dream speech not the I have a plan speech Listen to politicians now with their comprehensive 12point plans Theyre not inspiring anybody Because there are leaders and there are those who lead Leaders hold a position of power or authority but those who lead inspire us Whether theyre individuals or organizations we follow those who lead not because we have to but because we want to We follow those who lead not for them but for ourselves And its those who start with why that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them Thank you very muchWhen I was nine years old I went off to summer camp for the first time And my mother packed me a suitcase full of books which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do Because in my family reading was the primary group activity And this might sound antisocial to you but for us it was really just a different way of being social You have the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you but you are also free to go roaming around the adventureland inside your own mind And I had this idea that camp was going to be just like this but better I had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol And on the very first day our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit And it went like this ROWDIE thats the way we spell rowdie Rowdie rowdie lets get rowdie Yeah So I couldnt figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy or why we had to spell this word incorrectly But I recited a cheer I recited a cheer along with everybody else I did my best And I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books But the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me Why are you being so mellow  mellow of course being the exact opposite of ROWDIE And then the second time I tried it the counselor came up to me with a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all work very hard to be outgoing And so I put my books away back in their suitcase and I put them under my bed and there they stayed for the rest of the summer And I felt kind of guilty about this I felt as if the books needed me somehow and they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them But I did forsake them and I didnt open that suitcase again until I was back home with my family at the end of the summer Now I tell you this story about summer camp I could have told you 50 others just like it  all the times that I got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go that I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert And I always sensed deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were But for years I denied this intuition and so I became a Wall Street lawyer of all things instead of the writer that I had always longed to be  partly because I needed to prove to myself that I could be bold and assertive too And I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends And I made these selfnegating choices so reflexively that I wasnt even aware that I was making them Now this is what many introverts do and its our loss for sure but it is also our colleagues loss and our communities loss And at the risk of sounding grandiose it is the worlds loss Because when it comes to creativity and to leadership we need introverts doing what they do best A third to a half of the population are introverts  a third to a half So thats one out of every two or three people you know So even if youre an extrovert yourself Im talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting next to you right now  all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society We all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what were doing Now to see the bias clearly you need to understand what introversion is Its different from being shy Shyness is about fear of social judgment Introversion is more about how do you respond to stimulation including social stimulation So extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switchedon and their most capable when theyre in quieter more lowkey environments Not all the time  these things arent absolute  but a lot of the time So the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us But now heres where the bias comes in Our most important institutions our schools and our workplaces they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts need for lots of stimulation And also we have this belief system right now that I call the new groupthink which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place So if you picture the typical classroom nowadays When I was going to school we sat in rows We sat in rows of desks like this and we did most of our work pretty autonomously But nowadays your typical classroom has pods of desks  four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other And kids are working in countless group assignments Even in subjects like math and creative writing which you think would depend on solo flights of thought kids are now expected to act as committee members And for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone those kids are seen as outliers often or worse as problem cases And the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable according to research Okay same thing is true in our workplaces Now most of us work in open plan offices without walls where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers And when it comes to leadership introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions even though introverts tend to be very careful much less likely to take outsize risks  which is something we might all favor nowadays And interesting research by Adam Grant at the Wharton School has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts do because when they are managing proactive employees theyre much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas whereas an extrovert can quite unwittingly get so excited about things that theyre putting their own stamp on things and other peoples ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface Now in fact some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts Ill give you some examples Eleanor Roosevelt Rosa Parks Gandhi  all these people described themselves as quiet and softspoken and even shy And they all took the spotlight even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to And this turns out to have a special power all its own because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at they were there because they had no choice because they were driven to do what they thought was right Now I think at this point its important for me to say that I actually love extroverts I always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts including my beloved husband And we all fall at different points of course along the introvertextrovert spectrum Even Carl Jung the psychologist who first popularized these terms said that theres no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert He said that such a man would be in a lunatic asylum if he existed at all And some people fall smack in the middle of the introvertextrovert spectrum and we call these people ambiverts And I often think that they have the best of all worlds But many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other And what Im saying is that culturally we need a much better balance We need more of a yin and yang between these two types This is especially important when it comes to creativity and to productivity because when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them And this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity So Darwin he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinnerparty invitations Theodor Geisel better known as Dr Seuss he dreamed up many of his amazing creations in a lonely bell tower office that he had in the back of his house in La Jolla California And he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books for fear that they were expecting him this kind of jolly Santa Clauslike figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubicle in HewlettPackard where he was working at the time And he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up Now of course this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating  and case in point is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs to start Apple Computer  but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe And in fact we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude Its only recently that weve strangely begun to forget it If you look at most of the worlds major religions you will find seekers  Moses Jesus Buddha Muhammad  seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community So no wilderness no revelations This is no surprise though if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology It turns out that we cant even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring mimicking their opinions Even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who youre attracted to you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you without even realizing that thats what youre doing And groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room even though theres zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas  I mean zero So  You might be following the person with the best ideas but you might not And do you really want to leave it up to chance Much better for everybody to go off by themselves generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics and then come together as a team to talk them through in a wellmanaged environment and take it from there Now if all this is true then why are we getting it so wrong Why are we setting up our schools this way and our workplaces And why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time One answer lies deep in our cultural history Western societies and in particular the US have always favored the man of action over the man of contemplation But in Americas early days we lived in what historians call a culture of character where we still at that point valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude And if you look at the selfhelp books from this era they all had titles with things like Character the Grandest Thing in the World And they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln who was praised for being modest and unassuming Ralph Waldo Emerson called him A man who does not offend by superiority But then we hit the 20th century and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality What happened is we had evolved an agricultural economy to a world of big business And so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities And instead of working alongside people theyve known all their lives now they are having to prove themselves in a crowd of strangers So quite understandably qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important And sure enough the selfhelp books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like How to Win Friends and Influence People And they feature as their role models really great salesmen So thats the world were living in today Thats our cultural inheritance Now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant and Im also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all The same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops also teach us love and trust And the problems that we are facing today in fields like science and in economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them working together But I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems So now Id like to share with you whats in my suitcase today Guess what Books I have a suitcase full of books Heres Margaret Atwood Cats Eye Heres a novel by Milan Kundera And heres The Guide for the Perplexed by Maimonides But these are not exactly my books I brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfathers favorite authors My grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up partly because it was filled with his very gentle very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with books I mean literally every table every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books Just like the rest of my family my grandfathers favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read But he also loved his congregation and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi He would takes the fruits of each weeks reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought And people would come from all over to hear him speak But heres the thing about my grandfather Underneath this ceremonial role he was really modest and really introverted  so much so that when he delivered these sermons he had trouble making eye contact with the very same congregation that he had been speaking to for 62 years And even away from the podium when you called him to say hello he would often end the conversation prematurely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time But when he died at the age of 94 the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him And so these days I try to learn from my grandfathers example in my own way So I just published a book about introversion and it took me about seven years to write And for me that seven years was like total bliss because I was reading I was writing I was thinking I was researching It was my version of my grandfathers hours of the day alone in his library But now all of a sudden my job is very different and my job is to be out here talking about it talking about introversion And thats a lot harder for me because as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now this is not my natural milieu So I prepared for moments like these as best I could I spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance I could get And I call this my year of speaking dangerously And that actually helped a lot But Ill tell you what helps even more is my sense my belief my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude we truly are poised on the brink on dramatic change I mean we are And so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision Number one Stop the madness for constant group work Just stop it Thank you And I want to be clear about what Im saying because I deeply believe our offices should be encouraging casual chatty cafestyle types of interactions  you know the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas That is great Its great for introverts and its great for extroverts But we need much more privacy and much more freedom and much more autonomy at work School same thing We need to be teaching kids to work together for sure but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own This is especially important for extroverted children too They need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part Okay number two Go to the wilderness Be like Buddha have your own revelations Im not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again but I am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often Number three Take a good look at whats inside your own suitcase and why you put it there So extroverts maybe your suitcases are also full of books Or maybe theyre full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment Whatever it is I hope you take these things out every chance you get and grace us with your energy and your joy But introverts you being you you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully whats inside your own suitcase And thats okay But occasionally just occasionally I hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry So I wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly Thank you very muchOkay now I dont want to alarm anybody in this room but its just come to my attention that the person to your right is a liar Also the person to your left is a liar Also the person sitting in your very seats is a liar Were all liars What Im going to do today is Im going to show you what the research says about why were all liars how you can become a liespotter and why you might want to go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking and ultimately to trust building Now speaking of trust ever since I wrote this book Liespotting no one wants to meet me in person anymore no no no no no They say Its okay well email you I cant even get a coffee date at Starbucks My husbands like Honey deception Maybe you could have focused on cooking How about French cooking So before I get started what Im going to do is Im going to clarify my goal for you which is not to teach a game of Gotcha Liespotters arent those nitpicky kids those kids in the back of the room that are shouting Gotcha Gotcha Your eyebrow twitched You flared your nostril I watch that TV show Lie To Me I know youre lying No liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge of how to spot deception They use it to get to the truth and they do what mature leaders do everyday they have difficult conversations with difficult people sometimes during very difficult times And they start up that path by accepting a core proposition and that proposition is the following Lying is a cooperative act Think about it a lie has no power whatsoever by its mere utterance Its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie footnote footnote So I know it may sound like tough love but look if at some point you got lied to its because you agreed to get lied to Truth number one about lying Lyings a cooperative act Now not all lies are harmful Sometimes were willing participants in deception for the sake of social dignity maybe to keep a secret that should be kept secret secret We say Nice song Honey you dont look fat in that no Or we say favorite of the digiratti You know I just fished that email out of my Spam folder So sorry footnote footnote But there are times when we are unwilling participants in deception And that can have dramatic costs for us Last year saw 997 billion dollars in corporate fraud alone in the United States Thats an eyelash under a trillion dollars Thats seven percent of revenues Deception can cost billions Think Enron Madoff the mortgage crisis Or in the case of double agents and traitors like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames lies can betray our country they can compromise our security they can undermine democracy they can cause the deaths of those that defend us Deception is actually serious business This con man Henry Oberlander he was such an effective con man British authorities say he could have undermined the entire banking system of the Western world And you cant find this guy on Google you cant find him anywhere He was interviewed once and he said the following He said Look Ive got one rule And this was Henrys rule he said Look everyone is willing to give you something Theyre ready to give you something for whatever it is theyre hungry for And thats the crux of it If you dont want to be deceived you have to know what is it that youre hungry for And we all kind of hate to admit it We wish we were better husbands better wives smarter more powerful taller richer  the list goes on Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were how we wish we could be with what were really like And boy are we willing to fill in those gaps in our lives with lies On a given day studies show that you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times Now granted many of those are white lies But in another study it showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other footnote footnote Now when we first hear this data we recoil We cant believe how prevalent lying is Were essentially against lying But if you look more closely the plot actually thickens We lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers Extroverts lie more than introverts Men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people Women lie more to protect other people If youre an average married couple youre going to lie to your spouse in one out of every 10 interactions Now you may think thats bad If youre unmarried that number drops to three Lyings complex Its woven into the fabric of our daily and our business lives Were deeply ambivalent about the truth We parse it out on an asneeded basis sometimes for very good reasons other times just because we dont understand the gaps in our lives Thats truth number two about lying Were against lying but were covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned for centuries and centuries and centuries Its as old as breathing Its part of our culture its part of our history Think Dante Shakespeare the Bible News of the World footnote footnote Lying has evolutionary value to us as a species Researchers have long known that the more intelligent the species the larger the neocortex the more likely it is to be deceptive Now you might remember Koko Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla who was taught sign language Koko was taught to communicate via sign language Heres Koko with her kitten Its her cute little fluffy pet kitten Koko once blamed her pet kitten for ripping a sink out of the wall footnote footnote Were hardwired to become leaders of the pack Its starts really really early How early Well babies will fake a cry pause wait to see whos coming and then go right back to crying Oneyearolds learn concealment footnote footnote Twoyearolds bluff Fiveyearolds lie outright They manipulate via flattery Nineyearolds masters of the coverup By the time you enter college youre going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions By the time we enter this work world and were breadwinners we enter a world that is just cluttered with Spam fake digital friends partisan media ingenious identity thieves worldclass Ponzi schemers a deception epidemic  in short what one author calls a posttruth society Its been very confusing for a long time now footnote footnote What do you do Well there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass Trained liespotters get to the truth 90 percent of the time The rest of us were only 54 percent accurate Why is it so easy to learn There are good liars and bad liars There are no real original liars We all make the same mistakes We all use the same techniques So what Im going to do is Im going to show you two patterns of deception And then were going to look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves Were going to start with speech Bill Clinton I want you to listen to me Im going to say this again I did not have sexual relations with that woman Miss Lewinsky I never told anybody to lie not a single time never And these allegations are false And I need to go back to work for the American people Thank you footnote footnote Pamela Meyer Okay what were the telltale signs Well first we heard whats known as a noncontracted denial Studies show that people who are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather than informal language We also heard distancing language that woman We know that liars will unconsciously distance themselves from their subject using language as their tool Now if Bill Clinton had said Well to tell you the truth  or Richard Nixons favorite In all candor  he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter that knows that qualifying language as its called qualifying language like that further discredits the subject Now if he had repeated the question in its entirety or if he had peppered his account with a little too much detail  and were all really glad he didnt do that  he would have further discredited himself footnote footnote Freud had it right Freud said look theres much more to it than speech No mortal can keep a secret If his lips are silent he chatters with his fingertips And we all do it no matter how powerful you are We all chatter with our fingertips Im going to show you Dominique StraussKahn with Obama whos chattering with his fingertips footnote footnote Now this brings us to our next pattern which is body language With body language heres what youve got to do Youve really got to just throw your assumptions out the door Let the science temper your knowledge a little bit Because we think liars fidget all the time Well guess what theyre known to freeze their upper bodies when theyre lying We think liars wont look you in the eyes Well guess what they look you in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth We think warmth and smiles convey honesty sincerity But a trained liespotter can spot a fake smile a mile away Can you all spot the fake smile here You can consciously contract the muscles in your cheeks But the real smiles in the eyes the crows feet of the eyes They cannot be consciously contracted especially if you overdid the Botox Dont overdo the Botox nobody will think youre honest footnote footnote Now were going to look at the hot spots Can you tell whats happening in a conversation Can you start to find the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someones words and someones actions Now I know it seems really obvious but when youre having a conversation with someone you suspect of deception attitude is by far the most overlooked but telling of indicators footnote footnote An honest person is going to be cooperative Theyre going to show theyre on your side Theyre going to be enthusiastic Theyre going to be willing and helpful to getting you to the truth Theyre going to be willing to brainstorm name suspects provide details Theyre going to say Hey maybe it was those guys in payroll that forged those checks Theyre going to be infuriated if they sense theyre wrongly accused throughout the entire course of the interview not just in flashes theyll be infuriated throughout the entire course of the interview And if you ask someone honest what should happen to whomever did forge those checks an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather than lenient punishment Now lets say youre having that exact same conversation with someone deceptive That person may be withdrawn look down lower their voice pause be kind of herkyjerky Ask a deceptive person to tell their story theyre going to pepper it with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places And then theyre going to tell their story in strict chronological order And what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle ways over the course of several hours they will ask that person to tell that story backwards and then theyll watch them squirm and track which questions produce the highest volume of deceptive tells Why do they do that Well we all do the same thing We rehearse our words but we rarely rehearse our gestures We say yes we shake our heads no We tell very convincing stories we slightly shrug our shoulders We commit terrible crimes and we smile at the delight in getting away with it Now that smile is known in the trade as duping delight footnote footnote And were going to see that in several videos moving forward but were going to start  for those of you who dont know him this is presidential candidate John Edwards who shocked America by fathering a child out of wedlock Were going to see him talk about getting a paternity test See now if you can spot him saying yes while shaking his head no slightly shrugging his shoulders John Edwards Id be happy to participate in one I know that its not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events So I know its not possible Happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen Interviewer Are you going to do that soon Is there somebody  JE Well Im only one side Im only one side of the test But Im happy to participate in one footnote footnote PM Okay those head shakes are much easier to spot once you know to look for them There are going to be times when someone makes one expression while masking another that just kind of leaks through in a flash Murderers are known to leak sadness Your new joint venture partner might shake your hand celebrate go out to dinner with you and then leak an expression of anger And were not all going to become facial expression experts overnight here but theres one I can teach you thats very dangerous and its easy to learn and thats the expression of contempt Now with anger youve got two people on an even playing field Its still somewhat of a healthy relationship But when anger turns to contempt youve been dismissed Its associated with moral superiority And for that reason its very very hard to recover from Heres what it looks like Its marked by one lip corner pulled up and in Its the only asymmetrical expression And in the presence of contempt whether or not deception follows  and it doesnt always follow  look the other way go the other direction reconsider the deal say No thank you Im not coming up for just one more nightcap Thank you footnote footnote Science has surfaced many many more indicators We know for example we know liars will shift their blink rate point their feet towards an exit They will take barrier objects and put them between themselves and the person that is interviewing them Theyll alter their vocal tone often making their vocal tone much lower footnote footnote Now heres the deal These behaviors are just behaviors Theyre not proof of deception Theyre red flags Were human beings We make deceptive flailing gestures all over the place all day long They dont mean anything in and of themselves But when you see clusters of them thats your signal Look listen probe ask some hard questions get out of that very comfortable mode of knowing walk into curiosity mode ask more questions have a little dignity treat the person youre talking to with rapport Dont try to be like those folks on Law amp Order and those other TV shows that pummel their subjects into submission Dont be too aggressive it doesnt work Now weve talked a little bit about how to talk to someone whos lying and how to spot a lie And as I promised were now going to look at what the truth looks like But Im going to show you two videos two mothers  one is lying one is telling the truth And these were surfaced by researcher David Matsumoto in California And I think theyre an excellent example of what the truth looks like This mother Diane Downs shot her kids at close range drove them to the hospital while they bled all over the car claimed a scraggyhaired stranger did it And youll see when you see the video she cant even pretend to be an agonizing mother What you want to look for here is an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes and her very very cool demeanor And if you look closely youll see duping delight throughout this video Diane Downs At night when I close my eyes I can see Christie reaching her hand out to me while Im driving and the blood just kept coming out of her mouth And that  maybe itll fade too with time  but I dont think so That bothers me the most PM Now Im going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother Erin Runnion confronting her daughters murderer and torturer in court Here youre going to see no false emotion just the authentic expression of a mothers agony Erin Runnion I wrote this statement on the third anniversary of the night you took my baby and you hurt her and you crushed her you terrified her until her heart stopped And she fought and I know she fought you But I know she looked at you with those amazing brown eyes and you still wanted to kill her And I dont understand it and I never will PM Okay theres no doubting the veracity of those emotions Now the technology around what the truth looks like is progressing on the science of it We know for example that we now have specialized eye trackers and infrared brain scans MRIs that can decode the signals that our bodies send out when were trying to be deceptive And these technologies are going to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit and they will prove incredibly useful some day But youve got to ask yourself in the meantime Who do you want on your side of the meeting someone whos trained in getting to the truth or some guy whos going to drag a 400pound electroencephalogram through the door Liespotters rely on human tools They know as someone once said Characters who you are in the dark And whats kind of interesting is that today we have so little darkness Our world is lit up 24 hours a day Its transparent with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live their lives in public Its a much more noisy world So one challenge we have is to remember oversharing thats not honesty Our manic tweeting and texting can blind us to the fact that the subtleties of human decency  character integrity  thats still what matters thats always whats going to matter So in this much noisier world it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit about our moral code When you combine the science of recognizing deception with the art of looking listening you exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie You start up that path of being just a little bit more explicit because you signal to everyone around you you say Hey my world our world its going to be an honest one My world is going to be one where truth is strengthened and falsehood is recognized and marginalized And when you do that the ground around you starts to shift just a little bit And thats the truth Thank youBigger welcome Hello San Francisco TEDx – oh my God blinding light Hi everybody How are you Fine Oh my gosh Okay so My name is Mel Robbins and for the last seventeen years I have done nothing but help people get everything that they want Within reason My husbands here So Ive done it in the courtroom in the boardroom in the bedroom in peoples living room whatever room you want to be in if Im there I will help you get whatever you want by any means necessary For the last three years – I host a syndicated radio show Five days a week I go live in forty cities and I talk to men and women across America who feel stuck Do you know that a third of Americans feel dissatisfied with their lives right now That is a hundred million people Thats insane And Ive come face to face with it in this new show that Im doing which is also insane its called Inlaws I move in with families across America – You guessed it – who are at war with their inlaws We move them into the same house I verbally assassinate everybody we open up Pandoras box and I get people to stop arguing about the donuts and who is hosting Thanksgiving dinner and talk about the real stuff And thats what I want to talk to you about Im here for you Im going to tell you everything I know in less than eighteen minutes about how to get what you want So I want you to take a millisecond right now and think about what you want You And I want you to be selfish Screw Simon and the We thing This is about me right now Sorry Simon What do you want And heres the deal I dont want it to sound good to other people Being healthy will not get your ass on a treadmill Losing your manboobs so you can hook up with somebody now thats motivation So I want to know What do you want Do you want to lose weight Do you want to triple your income Do you want to start a nonprofit Do you want to find love What is it Get it right here You know what it is dont analyze it to death just pick something Thats part of the problem You wont pick So were going to be talking about how you get what you want And frankly getting what you want is simple But notice I didnt say it was easy Its very simple In fact if you think about it we live in the most amazing moment in time So that thing that you have up here whatever it may be you want to use healthy eating to cure your diabetes you want to figure out how to take care of the elders and start a new hospice center you want to move to Africa and build a school Guess what You can walk into a book store – right now – and buy at least ten books written by credentialed experts on how the hell you do it You could Google it And you could probably find at least I dont know  a thousand blogs documenting the step by step by step transformation that somebody else is already doing You can find anybody online and cyberstalk them You can just walk in their footsteps – just use the science of drafting Follow what everyone else has done because somebody is already doing it So why dont you have what you want when you have all the information that you need you have the contacts that you need there are probably free tools online that allow you to start a business or join a group or do whatever the heck you want It all comes down to one word F© Shut the front door you know what Im talking about The fbomb Its everywhere You hear it all the time I honestly dont understand what the appeal is of the word I mean you dont sound smart when you say it And its really not expressing how you really feel Its sort of a cheap shot to take And of course you know Im talking about the word fine How you doing Oh Im fine Oh really You are Dragging around those extra forty pounds youre fine Feeling like roommates with your spouse and youre fine You havent had sex in four months youre fine Really I dont think so But see heres the deal with saying that youre fine Its actually genius Because if youre fine you dont have to do anything about it But when you think about this word fine it just makes me so angry Here we are at a conference about being alive and youre going to describe the experience of being alive as fine What a flimsy and feeble word If youre crappy say youre crappy If youre amazing say youre amazing Tell the truth And this not only goes for the social construct Oh I dont want to burden you with the fact that I hate my life or Hey Im amazing But that would make you feel terrible The bigger issue – The bigger issue with fine is that you say it to yourself That thing that you want I guarantee you youve convinced yourself that youre fine not having it Thats why youre not pushing yourself Its the areas in your life where youve given up Where youve said Oh Im fine My moms never going to change so I just cant have that conversation Im fine Weve got to wait until the kids graduate before we get divorced so well just sleep in separate bedrooms Im fine I lost my job I can barely pay my bills but whatever – Its hard to get a job One of the reasons why this word also just annoys me so much is scientists have calculated – Oh yeah Im coming down Scientists have calculated the odds of you being born Thats right Theyve crunched the numbers I see you up there Theyve crunched the numbers on you – Yeah you guys standing up you want to sit down for this Theyve crunched the numbers on you being born And they took into account all of the wars and the natural disasters and the dinosaurs and everything else And do you realize that the odds the odds of you yeah right here put your computer away stand up for me Doug So the odds of Doug here turn around say hi to everybody – the odds of Doug being born at the moment in time he was born to the parents you were born to with the DNA structure that you have one in four hundred trillion Isnt that amazing Doug Im so lucky Mel Yes Youre not fine youre fantastic You have lifechanging ideas for a reason and its not to torture yourself Thank you Thank you Doug Christine was right when she said all of you could be on stage Because all of you – were all in this category One in four hundred trillion All day long you have ideas that could change your life that could change the world that could change the way that you feel and what do you do with them Nothing Hopefully I wont moon you You didnt pay for that And I want you to just think for a minute because we all have – I love to use the analogy the inner snooze button – you have these amazing ideas that bubble up Youve been watching people all day and I guarantee you like ping pong balls – bambambam and everytime you have an idea what do you do – Hit the snooze Whats the first decision you made this morning I bet it was to go back to bed Yeah first decision today Im one in four hundred trillion Im going to go back to sleep And I get it Your bed is comfortable Its cosy its warm If youre lucky youve got somebody that you love next to you or in my case Ive got my husband and my two kids and possibly the dog And the reason why Im bringing up this first decision that you made today and the inner snooze alarm is because in any area of your life that you want to change any – theres one fact that you need to know This one You are never going to feel like it Ever No ones coming motivation isnt happening youre never going to feel like it Scientists call it activation energy Thats what they call the force required to get you to change from what youre doing on autopilot to do something new So try this test tomorrow You think youre so fancy I know youre attending TED Try this Tomorrow morning set your alarm for thirty minutes earlier And then when it goes off take those sheets throw them off and stand up and start your day No snooze no delay no Ill just wait here for five seconds because Mels not standing here – Do it And the reason why I want you to do it is because you will come face to face with the physical and I mean physical force thats required to change your behavior Do you think that somebody who needs to lose weight ever feels like going on a diet Of course not You think they ever feel like eating boiled chicken and peas instead of a croissant I dont think so The activation energy required to get your ass away from your computer and out the front door to go on the walk you said that you were going to go on is the exact same amount of force that it takes you to push yourself out of a warm bed and into a cold room Whats interesting about being an adult is that when you become eighteen nobody tells you that its now going to be your job to parent yourself And by parent yourself I mean its your job to make yourself do the crap you dont want to do so you can be everything that youre supposed to be And youre so damn busy waiting to feel like it And youre never going to My son never feels like getting off his DS Thats my job Get off the damn DS Kendall clean up the Barbies If youre going to have a nude party in my bathroom at least clean it up God chew with your mouth closed Were not a barn for crying out loud Alright dinner is coming get out of the pantry As parents and you were a kid your parents make you do the things you dont feel like doing Because you wont Ever Not now not then not ever And even when you get good at something youll figure out something else you dont want to do And then youll plateau out get bored I hate this job Blah blah boring But will you look for a new one No Youll just bitch about that one Its very very simple to get what you want But its not easy You have to force yourself And I mean force And the reason why I use the word force – when Roz was up here and talking about the emotion tracking and she had the picture of two sides of the brain – I look at the brain the exact same way Only I describe one side of your brain as autopilot and the other side as emergency brake Thats the only two speeds you get autopilot emergency brake And guess which one your brain likes better autopilot Youve had the experience where youve driven to work and you get there and youre like Oh my God I dont remember ever driving here You werent drunk That was your brain on autopilot It was functioning just at this level And the problem with your mind is that anytime you do anything thats different from your normal routine guess what your brain does — emergency brake And it has that reaction for everything Everything You walk into the kitchen and see everybodys left their breakfast dishes for you And you think for the hundredth time Im going to kill them In fact Im gonna leave it here and Im going to make them do it But thats not your normal routine is it So your mind goes emergency brake And you go right into autopilot Ill just load it and be pissed and then not have sex Thats what Im going to do So when I say force anything thats a break from your routine is going to require force And if you think about your life its kind of funny because we are kids and then we become adults and we spend so much time trying to push our life into some sort of stable routine and then we grow bored of it You wake up at the same time every day you have largely the same breakfast you drive to work the same way show up at work look busy avoid making calls update Facebook you attend a meeting and doodle the whole time go back and update Facebook make plans for the evening you look busy some more then drive home the same way you eat largely the same dinner or a variety of it you watch the same kind of media and then you go to bed and do the same thing all over again No wonder youre bored out of your mind Its the routine thats killing you I have this theory about why people get stuck in life So most of youve probably taken your Basic Psych 101 class and youve bumped into Abraham Maslows Hierarchy of Needs Well your body is kinda cool Because you have these basic needs And your body is wired to send you signals If you need food what do you feel If you need water what do you feel If you need sex what do you feel Thank you I think when you feel stuck or dissatisfied in your life its a signal And its not a signal that your life is broken Its a signal that one of your most basic needs are not being met Your need for exploration Everything about your life about your body grows Your cells regenerate your hair your nails everything grows for your entire life And your soul needs exploration and growth And the only way youll get it is by forcing yourself to be uncomfortable Forcing yourself to get outside out of your head Thank you If youre in your head youre behind enemy lines That is not God talking okay Its not In fact if I put a speaker on it and we broadcast what you say to yourself we would institutionalize you You would not hang out with people that talk to you the way you talk to yourself So get out of your head Your feelings Your feelings are screwing you I dont care how you feel I care about what you want And if you listen to how you feel when it comes to what you want – you will not get it Because you will never feel like it And you need to get outside your comfort zone Its not about taking risks its about getting outside your comfort zone Those first three seconds when you push yourself out of bed they blow But once youre up its great Those first three seconds when youre sitting here in a stadium like this and somebody says Get up and come dance and you think Oh I should do that and then youre like Uhmm That experience that you had when you had the impulse to do it and then you didnt do the activation energy required to force yourself your emergency brake got pulled – Im sitting right here Im not going up with those crazy people I dont like to dance What happened for me is I came up and I bumped into Rachel and then we started talking and next thing you know shes tweeting And were friends And – boom Get outside Thats where the magic is Thats where the one in four hundred trillion exists So everything I do – oh OK this is the last part Sorry So one more thing that you can use I call it the fivesecondrule Your mind can process a facial expression in 33 milliseconds It can move pretty damn quick The other thing that it does very quickly is if you have one of those little impulses that are pulling you if you dont marry it with an action within five seconds you pull the emergency brake and kill the idea Kill it If you have the impulse to get up and come dance while the band is playing if you dont stand up in five seconds youre going to pull the emergency brake If you have an impulse about you were inspired by somebodys speech today and you dont do something within five seconds – write a note send yourself a text – anything physical to marry it with the idea you will pull the emergency brake and kill the idea Your problem isnt ideas Your problem is you dont act on them You kill them Its not my fault Its not anybodys fault Youre doing it to yourself Stop it Im counting on you One in four hundred trillion You got stuff to do And its not going to happen in your head So I want you to practice this today When we go off to party thank God its coming soon because I think we all could use a cocktail I want you to practice the fivesecondrule You see somebody and you think you have an impulse they look interesting Walk over there You were inspired by somebody and you have a request Make it Thats why youre here Experiment with it and I think youll be shocked about what happens And one more thing I want you to know that everything that I do whether its the radio show or the television show or the book that I wrote or the column its for you And if there is anything that I can do if I can do anything to make you do the things you dont want to do so you can have what you want I will do it But you need to walk over you need to open your mouth and you need to make the request You got it Good Go do it Thank you Thank you yes Stand up You have the impulse stand up Thank youWhat Id like to do today is talk about one of my favorite subjects and that is the neuroscience of sleep Now there is a sound  Ah it worked A sound that is desperately familiar to most of us and of course its the sound of the alarm clock And what that truly ghastly awful sound does is stop the single most important behavioral experience that we have and thats sleep If youre an average sort of person 36 percent of your life will be spent asleep which means that if you live to 90 then 32 years will have been spent entirely asleep Now what that 32 years is telling us is that sleep at some level is important And yet for most of us we dont give sleep a second thought We throw it away We really just dont think about sleep And so what Id like to do today is change your views change your ideas and your thoughts about sleep And the journey that I want to take you on we need to start by going back in time Enjoy the honeyheavy dew of slumber Any ideas who said that Shakespeares Julius Caesar Yes let me give you a few more quotes O sleep O gentle sleep natures soft nurse how have I frighted thee Shakespeare again from  I wont say it  the Scottish play From the same time Sleep is the golden chain that ties health and our bodies together Extremely prophetic by Thomas Dekker another Elizabethan dramatist But if we jump forward 400 years the tone about sleep changes somewhat This is from Thomas Edison from the beginning of the 20th century Sleep is a criminal waste of time and a heritage from our cave days Bang And if we also jump into the 1980s some of you may remember that Margaret Thatcher was reported to have said Sleep is for wimps And of course the infamous  what was his name  the infamous Gordon Gekko from Wall Street said Money never sleeps What do we do in the 20th century about sleep Well of course we use Thomas Edisons light bulb to invade the night and we occupied the dark and in the process of this occupation weve treated sleep as an illness almost Weve treated it as an enemy At most now I suppose we tolerate the need for sleep and at worst perhaps many of us think of sleep as an illness that needs some sort of a cure And our ignorance about sleep is really quite profound Why is it Why do we abandon sleep in our thoughts Well its because you dont do anything much while youre asleep it seems You dont eat You dont drink And you dont have sex Well most of us anyway And so therefore its  Sorry Its a complete waste of time right Wrong Actually sleep is an incredibly important part of our biology and neuroscientists are beginning to explain why its so very important So lets move to the brain Now here we have a brain This is donated by a social scientist and they said they didnt know what it was or indeed how to use it so  Sorry So I borrowed it I dont think they noticed OK The point Im trying to make is that when youre asleep this thing doesnt shut down In fact some areas of the brain are actually more active during the sleep state than during the wake state The other thing thats really important about sleep is that it doesnt arise from a single structure within the brain but is to some extent a network property If we flip the brain on its back  I love this little bit of spinal cord here  this bit here is the hypothalamus and right under there is a whole raft of interesting structures not least the biological clock The biological clock tells us when its good to be up when its good to be asleep and what that structure does is interact with a whole raft of other areas within the hypothalamus the lateral hypothalamus the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei All of those combine and they send projections down to the brain stem here The brain stem then projects forward and bathes the cortex this wonderfully wrinkly bit over here with neurotransmitters that keep us awake and essentially provide us with our consciousness So sleep arises from a whole raft of different interactions within the brain and essentially sleep is turned on and off as a result of a range of interactions in here OK So where have we got to Weve said that sleep is complicated and it takes 32 years of our life But what I havent explained is what sleep is about So why do we sleep And it wont surprise any of you that of course as scientists we dont have a consensus There are dozens of different ideas about why we sleep and Im going to outline three of those The first is sort of the restoration idea and its somewhat intuitive Essentially all the stuff weve burned up during the day we restore we replace we rebuild during the night And indeed as an explanation it goes back to Aristotle so thats what  2300 years ago Its gone in and out of fashion Its fashionable at the moment because whats been shown is that within the brain a whole raft of genes have been shown to be turned on only during sleep and those genes are associated with restoration and metabolic pathways So theres good evidence for the whole restoration hypothesis What about energy conservation Again perhaps intuitive You essentially sleep to save calories Now when you do the sums though it doesnt really pan out If you compare an individual who has slept at night or stayed awake and hasnt moved very much the energy saving of sleeping is about 110 calories a night Now thats the equivalent of a hot dog bun Now I would say that a hot dog bun is kind of a meager return for such a complicated and demanding behavior as sleep So Im less convinced by the energy conservation idea But the third idea Im quite attracted to which is brain processing and memory consolidation What we know is that if after youve tried to learn a task and you sleepdeprive individuals the ability to learn that task is smashed Its really hugely attenuated So sleep and memory consolidation is also very important However its not just the laying down of memory and recalling it Whats turned out to be really exciting is that our ability to come up with novel solutions to complex problems is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep In fact its been estimated to give us a threefold advantage Sleeping at night enhances our creativity And what seems to be going on is that in the brain those neural connections that are important those synaptic connections that are important are linked and strengthened while those that are less important tend to fade away and be less important OK So weve had three explanations for why we might sleep and I think the important thing to realize is that the details will vary and its probable we sleep for multiple different reasons But sleep is not an indulgence Its not some sort of thing that we can take on board rather casually I think that sleep was once likened to an upgrade from economy to business class you know the equivalent of Its not even an upgrade from economy to first class The critical thing to realize is that if you dont sleep you dont fly Essentially you never get there And whats extraordinary about much of our society these days is that we are desperately sleepdeprived So lets now look at sleep deprivation Huge sectors of society are sleepdeprived and lets look at our sleepometer So in the 1950s good data suggests that most of us were getting around eight hours of sleep a night Nowadays we sleep one and a half to two hours less every night so were in the sixandahalfhours everynight league For teenagers its worse much worse They need nine hours for full brain performance and many of them on a school night are only getting five hours of sleep Its simply not enough If we think about other sectors of society  the aged if you are aged then your ability to sleep in a single block is somewhat disrupted and many sleep again less than five hours a night Shift work Shift work is extraordinary perhaps 20 percent of the working population and the body clock does not shift to the demands of working at night Its locked onto the same lightdark cycle as the rest of us So when the poor old shift worker is going home to try and sleep during the day desperately tired the body clock is saying Wake up This is the time to be awake So the quality of sleep that you get as a night shift worker is usually very poor again in that sort of fivehour region And then of course tens of millions of people suffer from jet lag So who here has jet lag Well my goodness gracious Well thank you very much indeed for not falling asleep because thats what your brain is craving One of the things that the brain does is indulge in microsleeps this involuntary falling asleep and you have essentially no control over it Now microsleeps can be sort of somewhat embarrassing but they can also be deadly Its been estimated that 31 percent of drivers will fall asleep at the wheel at least once in their life and in the US the statistics are pretty good 100000 accidents on the freeway have been associated with tiredness loss of vigilance and falling asleep  a hundred thousand a year Its extraordinary At another level of terror we dip into the tragic accidents at Chernobyl and indeed the space shuttle Challenger which was so tragically lost And in the investigations that followed those disasters poor judgment as a result of extended shift work and loss of vigilance and tiredness was attributed to a big chunk of those disasters When youre tired and you lack sleep you have poor memory you have poor creativity you have increased impulsiveness and you have overall poor judgment But my friends its so much worse than that If you are a tired brain the brain is craving things to wake it up So drugs stimulants Caffeine represents the stimulant of choice across much of the Western world Much of the day is fueled by caffeine and if youre a really naughty tired brain nicotine Of course youre fueling the waking state with these stimulants and then of course it gets to 11 oclock at night and the brain says to itself Actually I need to be asleep fairly shortly What do we do about that when Im feeling completely wired Well of course you then resort to alcohol Now alcohol shortterm you know once or twice to use to mildly sedate you can be very useful It can actually ease the sleep transition But what you must be so aware of is that alcohol doesnt provide sleep A biological mimic for sleep it sedates you So it actually harms some of the neural processing thats going on during memory consolidation and memory recall So its a shortterm acute measure but for goodness sake dont become addicted to alcohol as a way of getting to sleep every night Another connection between loss of sleep is weight gain If you sleep around about five hours or less every night then you have a 50 percent likelihood of being obese Whats the connection here Well sleep loss seems to give rise to the release of the hormone ghrelin the hunger hormone Ghrelin is released It gets to the brain The brain says I need carbohydrates and what it does is seek out carbohydrates and particularly sugars So theres a link between tiredness and the metabolic predisposition for weight gain stress Tired people are massively stressed And one of the things of stress of course is loss of memory which is what I sort of just then had a little lapse of But stress is so much more So if youre acutely stressed not a great problem but its sustained stress associated with sleep loss thats the problem Sustained stress leads to suppressed immunity And so tired people tend to have higher rates of overall infection and theres some very good studies showing that shift workers for example have higher rates of cancer Increased levels of stress throw glucose into the circulation Glucose becomes a dominant part of the vasculature and essentially you become glucose intolerant Therefore diabetes 2 Stress increases cardiovascular disease as a result of raising blood pressure So theres a whole raft of things associated with sleep loss that are more than just a mildly impaired brain which is where I think most people think that sleep loss resides So at this point in the talk this is a nice time to think Well do you think on the whole Im getting enough sleep So a quick show of hands Who feels that theyre getting enough sleep here Oh Well thats pretty impressive Good Well talk more about that later about what are your tips So most of us of course ask the question How do I know whether Im getting enough sleep Well its not rocket science If you need an alarm clock to get you out of bed in the morning if you are taking a long time to get up if you need lots of stimulants if youre grumpy if youre irritable if youre told by your work colleagues that youre looking tired and irritable chances are you are sleepdeprived Listen to them Listen to yourself What do you do Well  and this is slightly offensive  sleep for dummies Make your bedroom a haven for sleep The first critical thing is make it as dark as you possibly can and also make it slightly cool Very important Actually reduce your amount of light exposure at least half an hour before you go to bed Light increases levels of alertness and will delay sleep Whats the last thing that most of us do before we go to bed We stand in a massively lit bathroom looking into the mirror cleaning our teeth Its the worst thing we can possibly do before we go to sleep Turn off those mobile phones Turn off those computers Turn off all of those things that are also going to excite the brain Try not to drink caffeine too late in the day ideally not after lunch Now weve set about reducing light exposure before you go to bed but light exposure in the morning is very good at setting the biological clock to the lightdark cycle So seek out morning light Basically listen to yourself Wind down Do those sorts of things that you know are going to ease you off into the honeyheavy dew of slumber OK Thats some facts What about some myths Teenagers are lazy No Poor things They have a biological predisposition to go to bed late and get up late so give them a break We need eight hours of sleep a night Thats an average Some people need more Some people need less And what you need to do is listen to your body Do you need that much or do you need more Simple as that Old people need less sleep Not true The sleep demands of the aged do not go down Essentially sleep fragments and becomes less robust but sleep requirements do not go down And the fourth myth is early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise Well thats wrong at so many different levels There is no evidence that getting up early and going to bed early gives you more wealth at all Theres no difference in socioeconomic status In my experience the only difference between morning people and evening people is that those people that get up in the morning early are just horribly smug OK So for the last few minutes what I want to do is change gears and talk about some really new breaking areas of neuroscience which is the association between mental health mental illness and sleep disruption Weve known for 130 years that in severe mental illness there is always always sleep disruption but its been largely ignored In the 1970s when people started to think about this again they said Yes well of course you have sleep disruption in schizophrenia because theyre on antipsychotics Its the antipsychotics causing the sleep problems ignoring the fact that for a hundred years previously sleep disruption had been reported before antipsychotics So whats going on Several groups are studying conditions like depression schizophrenia and bipolar and whats going on in terms of sleep disruption We have a big study which we published last year on schizophrenia and the data were quite extraordinary In those individuals with schizophrenia much of the time they were awake during the night phase and then they were asleep during the day Other groups showed no 24hour patterns whatsoever  their sleep was absolutely smashed And some had no ability to regulate their sleep by the lightdark cycle They were getting up later and later and later and later each night It was smashed So whats going on And the really exciting news is that mental illness and sleep are not simply associated but they are physically linked within the brain The neural networks that predispose you to normal sleep give you normal sleep and those that give you normal mental health are overlapping And whats the evidence for that Well genes that have been shown to be very important in the generation of normal sleep when mutated when changed also predispose individuals to mental health problems And last year we published a study which showed that a gene thats been linked to schizophrenia when mutated also smashes the sleep So we have evidence of a genuine mechanistic overlap between these two important systems Other work flowed from these studies The first was that sleep disruption actually precedes certain types of mental illness and weve shown that in those young individuals who are at high risk of developing bipolar disorder they already have a sleep abnormality prior to any clinical diagnosis of bipolar The other bit of data was that sleep disruption may actually exacerbate make worse the mental illness state My colleague Dan Freeman has used a range of agents which have stabilized sleep and reduced levels of paranoia in those individuals by 50 percent So what have we got Weve got in these connections some really exciting things In terms of the neuroscience by understanding these two systems were really beginning to understand how both sleep and mental illness are generated and regulated within the brain The second area is that if we can use sleep and sleep disruption as an early warning signal then we have the chance of going in If we know these individuals are vulnerable early intervention then becomes possible And the third which I think is the most exciting is that we can think of the sleep centers within the brain as a new therapeutic target Stabilize sleep in those individuals who are vulnerable we can certainly make them healthier but also alleviate some of the appalling symptoms of mental illness So let me just finish What I started by saying is Take sleep seriously Our attitudes toward sleep are so very different from a preindustrial age when we were almost wrapped in a duvet We used to understand intuitively the importance of sleep And this isnt some sort of crystalwaving nonsense This is a pragmatic response to good health If you have good sleep it increases your concentration attention decisionmaking creativity social skills health If you get sleep it reduces your mood changes your stress your levels of anger your impulsivity and your tendency to drink and take drugs And we finished by saying that an understanding of the neuroscience of sleep is really informing the way we think about some of the causes of mental illness and indeed is providing us new ways to treat these incredibly debilitating conditions Jim Butcher the fantasy writer said Sleep is God Go worship And I can only recommend that you do the same Thank you for your attentionI need to make a confession at the outset here A little over 20 years ago I did something that I regret something that Im not particularly proud of Something that in many ways I wish no one would ever know but here I feel kind of obliged to reveal In the late 1980s in a moment of youthful indiscretion I went to law school In America law is a professional degree after your university degree you go on to law school When I got to law school I didnt do very well To put it mildly I didnt do very well I in fact graduated in the part of my law school class that made the top 90 possible Thank you I never practiced law a day in my life I pretty much wasnt allowed to But today against my better judgment against the advice of my own wife I want to try to dust off some of those legal skills  whats left of those legal skills I dont want to tell you a story I want to make a case I want to make a hardheaded evidencebased dare I say lawyerly case for rethinking how we run our businesses So ladies and gentlemen of the jury take a look at this This is called the candle problem Some of you might know it Its created in 1945 by a psychologist named Karl Duncker He created this experiment that is used in many other experiments in behavioral science And heres how it works Suppose Im the experimenter I bring you into a room I give you a candle some thumbtacks and some matches And I say to you Your job is to attach the candle to the wall so the wax doesnt drip onto the table Now what would you do Many people begin trying to thumbtack the candle to the wall Doesnt work I saw somebody kind of make the motion over here  some people have a great idea where they light the match melt the side of the candle try to adhere it to the wall Its an awesome idea Doesnt work And eventually after five or ten minutes most people figure out the solution which you can see here The key is to overcome whats called functional fixedness You look at that box and you see it only as a receptacle for the tacks But it can also have this other function as a platform for the candle The candle problem I want to tell you about an experiment using the candle problem done by a scientist named Sam Glucksberg who is now at Princeton University US This shows the power of incentives He gathered his participants and said Im going to time you how quickly you can solve this problem To one group he said Im going to time you to establish norms averages for how long it typically takes someone to solve this sort of problem To the second group he offered rewards He said If youre in the top 25 of the fastest times you get five dollars If youre the fastest of everyone were testing here today you get 20 dollars Now this is several years ago adjusted for inflation its a decent sum of money for a few minutes of work Its a nice motivator Question How much faster did this group solve the problem Answer It took them on average three and a half minutes longer 35 min longer This makes no sense right I mean Im an American I believe in free markets Thats not how its supposed to work right If you want people to perform better you reward them Right Bonuses commissions their own reality show Incentivize them Thats how business works But thats not happening here Youve got an incentive designed to sharpen thinking and accelerate creativity and it does just the opposite It dulls thinking and blocks creativity Whats interesting about this experiment is that its not an aberration This has been replicated over and over again for nearly 40 years These contingent motivators  if you do this then you get that  work in some circumstances But for a lot of tasks they actually either dont work or often they do harm This is one of the most robust findings in social science and also one of the most ignored I spent the last couple of years looking at the science of human motivation particularly the dynamics of extrinsic motivators and intrinsic motivators And Im telling you its not even close If you look at the science there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does Whats alarming here is that our business operating system  think of the set of assumptions and protocols beneath our businesses how we motivate people how we apply our human resources its built entirely around these extrinsic motivators around carrots and sticks Thats actually fine for many kinds of 20th century tasks But for 21st century tasks that mechanistic rewardandpunishment approach doesnt work often doesnt work and often does harm Let me show you Glucksberg did another similar experiment he presented the problem in a slightly different way like this up here Attach the candle to the wall so the wax doesnt drip onto the table Same deal You were timing for norms You were incentivizing What happened this time This time the incentivized group kicked the other groups butt Why Because when the tacks are out of the box its pretty easy isnt it Ifthen rewards work really well for those sorts of tasks where there is a simple set of rules and a clear destination to go to Rewards by their very nature narrow our focus concentrate the mind thats why they work in so many cases So for tasks like this a narrow focus where you just see the goal right there zoom straight ahead to it they work really well But for the real candle problem you dont want to be looking like this The solution is on the periphery You want to be looking around That reward actually narrows our focus and restricts our possibility Let me tell you why this is so important In western Europe in many parts of Asia in North America in Australia whitecollar workers are doing less of this kind of work and more of this kind of work That routine rulebased leftbrain work  certain kinds of accounting financial analysis computer programming  has become fairly easy to outsource fairly easy to automate Software can do it faster Lowcost providers can do it cheaper So what really matters are the more rightbrained creative conceptual kinds of abilities Think about your own work Think about your own work Are the problems that you face or even the problems weve been talking about here do they have a clear set of rules and a single solution No The rules are mystifying The solution if it exists at all is surprising and not obvious Everybody in this room is dealing with their own version of the candle problem And for candle problems of any kind in any field those ifthen rewards the things around which weve built so many of our businesses dont work It makes me crazy And heres the thing This is not a feeling Okay Im a lawyer I dont believe in feelings This is not a philosophy Im an American I dont believe in philosophy This is a fact  or as we say in my hometown of Washington DC a true fact Let me give you an example Let me marshal the evidence here Im not telling a story Im making a case Ladies and gentlemen of the jury some evidence Dan Ariely one of the great economists of our time he and three colleagues did a study of some MIT students They gave these MIT students a bunch of games games that involved creativity and motor skills and concentration And the offered them for performance three levels of rewards small reward medium reward large reward If you do really well you get the large reward on down What happened As long as the task involved only mechanical skill bonuses worked as they would be expected the higher the pay the better the performance Okay But once the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill a larger reward led to poorer performance Then they said Lets see if theres any cultural bias here Lets go to Madurai India and test it Standard of living is lower In Madurai a reward that is modest in North American standards is more meaningful there Same deal A bunch of games three levels of rewards What happens People offered the medium level of rewards did no better than people offered the small rewards But this time people offered the highest rewards they did the worst of all In eight of the nine tasks we examined across three experiments higher incentives led to worse performance Is this some kind of touchyfeely socialist conspiracy going on here No these are economists from MIT from Carnegie Mellon from the University of Chicago Do you know who sponsored this research The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States Thats the American experience Lets go across the pond to the London School of Economics LSE London School of Economics alma mater of eleven Nobel Laureates in economics Training ground for great economic thinkers like George Soros and Friedrich Hayek and Mick Jagger Last month just last month economists at LSE looked at 51 studies of payforperformance plans inside of companies Heres what they said We find that financial incentives can result in a negative impact on overall performance There is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does And what worries me as we stand here in the rubble of the economic collapse is that too many organizations are making their decisions their policies about talent and people based on assumptions that are outdated unexamined and rooted more in folklore than in science And if we really want to get out of this economic mess if we really want high performance on those definitional tasks of the 21st century the solution is not to do more of the wrong things to entice people with a sweeter carrot or threaten them with a sharper stick We need a whole new approach The good news is that the scientists whove been studying motivation have given us this new approach Its built much more around intrinsic motivation Around the desire to do things because they matter because we like it theyre interesting or part of something important And to my mind that new operating system for our businesses revolves around three elements autonomy mastery and purpose Autonomy the urge to direct our own lives Mastery the desire to get better and better at something that matters Purpose the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves These are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system for our businesses I want to talk today only about autonomy In the 20th century we came up with this idea of management Management did not emanate from nature Management is not a tree its a television set Somebody invented it It doesnt mean its going to work forever Management is great Traditional notions of management are great if you want compliance But if you want engagement selfdirection works better Some examples of some kind of radical notions of selfdirection You dont see a lot of it but you see the first stirrings of something really interesting going on what it means is paying people adequately and fairly absolutely  getting the issue of money off the table and then giving people lots of autonomy Some examples How many of you have heard of the company Atlassian It looks like less than half Atlassian is an Australian software company And they do something incredibly cool A few times a year they tell their engineers Go for the next 24 hours and work on anything you want as long as its not part of your regular job Work on anything you want Engineers use this time to come up with a cool patch for code come up with an elegant hack Then they present all of the stuff that theyve developed to their teammates to the rest of the company in this wild and woolly allhands meeting at the end of the day Being Australians everybody has a beer They call them FedEx Days Why Because you have to deliver something overnight Its pretty not bad Its a huge trademark violation but its pretty clever That one day of intense autonomy has produced a whole array of software fixes that might never have existed Its worked so well that Atlassian has taken it to the next level with 20 time  done famously at Google  where engineers can spend 20 of their time working on anything they want They have autonomy over their time their task their team their technique Radical amounts of autonomy And at Google as many of you know about half of the new products in a typical year are birthed during that 20 time things like Gmail Orkut Google News Let me give you an even more radical example of it something called the Results Only Work Environment  created by two American consultants in place at a dozen companies around North America In a ROWE people dont have schedules They show up when they want They dont have to be in the office at a certain time or any time They just have to get their work done How they do it when they do it where they do it is totally up to them Meetings in these kinds of environments are optional What happens Almost across the board productivity goes up worker engagement goes up worker satisfaction goes up turnover goes down Autonomy mastery and purpose the building blocks of a new way of doing things Some of you might look at this and say Hmm that sounds nice but its Utopian And I say Nope I have proof The mid1990s Microsoft started an encyclopedia called Encarta They had deployed all the right incentives They paid professionals to write and edit thousands of articles Wellcompensated managers oversaw the whole thing to make sure it came in on budget and on time A few years later another encyclopedia got started Different model right Do it for fun No one gets paid a cent or a euro or a yen Do it because you like to do it Just 10 years ago if you had gone to an economist anywhere Hey Ive got these two different models for creating an encyclopedia If they went head to head who would win 10 years ago you could not have found a single sober economist anywhere on planet Earth who would have predicted the Wikipedia model This is the titanic battle between these two approaches This is the AliFrazier of motivation right This is the Thrilla in Manila Intrinsic motivators versus extrinsic motivators Autonomy mastery and purpose versus carrot and sticks and who wins Intrinsic motivation autonomy mastery and purpose in a knockout Let me wrap up There is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does Here is what science knows One Those 20th century rewards those motivators we think are a natural part of business do work but only in a surprisingly narrow band of circumstances Two Those ifthen rewards often destroy creativity Three The secret to high performance isnt rewards and punishments but that unseen intrinsic drive the drive to do things for their own sake The drive to do things cause they matter And heres the best part We already know this The science confirms what we know in our hearts So if we repair this mismatch between science and business if we bring our motivation notions of motivation into the 21st century if we get past this lazy dangerous ideology of carrots and sticks we can strengthen our businesses we can solve a lot of those candle problems and maybe maybe  we can change the world I rest my caseI grew up to study the brain because I have a brother who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder schizophrenia And as a sister and later as a scientist I wanted to understand why is it that I can take my dreams I can connect them to my reality and I can make my dreams come true What is it about my brothers brain and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams to a common and shared reality so they instead become delusion So I dedicated my career to research into the severe mental illnesses And I moved from my home state of Indiana to Boston where I was working in the lab of Dr Francine Benes in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry And in the lab we were asking the question What are the biological differences between the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia schizoaffective or bipolar disorder So we were essentially mapping the microcircuitry of the brain which cells are communicating with which cells with which chemicals and then in what quantities of those chemicals So there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing this type of research during the day but then in the evenings and on the weekends I traveled as an advocate for NAMI the National Alliance on Mental Illness But on the morning of December 10 1996 I woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own A blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain And in the course of four hours I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information On the morning of the hemorrhage I could not walk talk read write or recall any of my life I essentially became an infant in a womans body If youve ever seen a human brain its obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another And I have brought for you a real human brain So this is a real human brain This is the front of the brain the back of brain with the spinal cord hanging down and this is how it would be positioned inside of my head And when you look at the brain its obvious that the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another For those of you who understand computers our right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor while our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor The two hemispheres do communicate with one another through the corpus callosum which is made up of some 300 million axonal fibers But other than that the two hemispheres are completely separate Because they process information differently each of our hemispheres think about different things they care about different things and dare I say they have very different personalities Excuse me Thank you Its been a joy Assistant It has been Our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment Its all about right here right now Our right hemisphere it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies Information in the form of energy streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like what this present moment smells like and tastes like what it feels like and what it sounds like I am an energybeing connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere We are energybeings connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human family And right here right now we are brothers and sisters on this planet here to make the world a better place And in this moment we are perfect we are whole and we are beautiful My left hemisphere our left hemisphere is a very different place Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically Our left hemisphere is all about the past and its all about the future Our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage of the present moment and start picking out details and more details about those details It then categorizes and organizes all that information associates it with everything in the past weve ever learned and projects into the future all of our possibilities And our left hemisphere thinks in language Its that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world Its that little voice that says to me Hey youve got to remember to pick up bananas on your way home I need them in the morning Its that calculating intelligence that reminds me when I have to do my laundry But perhaps most important its that little voice that says to me I am I am And as soon as my left hemisphere says to me I am I become separate I become a single solid individual separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you And this was the portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke On the morning of the stroke I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye And it was the kind of caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream And it just gripped me  and then it released me And then it just gripped me  and then it released me And it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain so I thought OK Ill just start my normal routine So I got up and I jumped onto my cardio glider which is a fullbody fullexercise machine And Im jamming away on this thing and Im realizing that my hands look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar And I thought Thats very peculiar And I looked down at my body and I thought Whoa Im a weirdlooking thing And it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality where Im the person on the machine having the experience to some esoteric space where Im witnessing myself having this experience And it was all very peculiar and my headache was just getting worse So I get off the machine and Im walking across my living room floor and I realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down And every step is very rigid and very deliberate Theres no fluidity to my pace and theres this constriction in my area of perception so Im just focused on internal systems And Im standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower and I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body I heard a little voice saying OK You muscles youve got to contract You muscles you relax And then I lost my balance and Im propped up against the wall And I look down at my arm and I realize that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body I cant define where I begin and where I end because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall And all I could detect was this energy  energy And Im asking myself What is wrong with me What is going on And in that moment my left hemisphere brain chatter went totally silent Just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button Total silence And at first I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind But then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me And because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body I felt enormous and expansive I felt at one with all the energy that was and it was beautiful there Then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me Hey Weve got a problem Weve got to get some help And Im going Ahh Ive got a problem So its like OK Ive got a problem But then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness  and I affectionately refer to this space as La La Land But it was beautiful there Imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world So here I am in this space and my job and any stress related to my job  it was gone And I felt lighter in my body And imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any stressors related to any of those  they were gone And I felt this sense of peacefulness And imagine what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage Oh I felt euphoria  euphoria It was beautiful And again my left hemisphere comes online and it says Hey Youve got to pay attention Weve got to get help And Im thinking Ive got to get help Ive got to focus So I get out of the shower and I mechanically dress and Im walking around my apartment and Im thinking Ive got to get to work Can I drive And in that moment my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side Then I realized Oh my gosh Im having a stroke And the next thing my brain says to me is Wow This is so cool This is so cool How many brain scientists have the opportunity to study their own brain from the inside out And then it crosses my mind But Im a very busy woman I dont have time for a stroke So Im like OK I cant stop the stroke from happening so Ill do this for a week or two and then Ill get back to my routine OK So Ive got to call help Ive got to call work I couldnt remember the number at work so I remembered in my office I had a business card with my number So I go into my business room I pull out a threeinch stack of business cards And Im looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly in my minds eye what my business card looked like I couldnt tell if this was my card or not because all I could see were pixels And the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols and I just couldnt tell And then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity And in that moment I would be able to reattach to normal reality and I could tell thats not the card thats not the card It took me 45 minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards In the meantime for 45 minutes the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere I do not understand numbers I do not understand the telephone but its the only plan I have So I take the phone pad and I put it right here I take the business card I put it right here and Im matching the shape of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles on the phone pad But then I would drift back out into La La Land and not remember when I came back if Id already dialed those numbers So I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers as I went along and pushed them so that as I would come back to normal reality Id be able to tell Yes Ive already dialed that number Eventually the whole number gets dialed and Im listening to the phone and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me Woo woo woo woo And I think to myself Oh my gosh he sounds like a Golden Retriever And so I say to him  clear in my mind I say to him This is Jill I need help And what comes out of my voice is Woo woo woo woo woo Im thinking Oh my gosh I sound like a Golden Retriever So I couldnt know  I didnt know that I couldnt speak or understand language until I tried So he recognizes that I need help and he gets me help And a little while later I am riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston to Massachusetts General Hospital And I curl up into a little fetal ball And just like a balloon with the last bit of air just right out of the balloon I just felt my energy lift and just I felt my spirit surrender And in that moment I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life And either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life or this was perhaps my moment of transition When I woke later that afternoon I was shocked to discover that I was still alive When I felt my spirit surrender I said goodbye to my life And my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality Stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain Light burned my brain like wildfire and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise and I just wanted to escape Because I could not identify the position of my body in space I felt enormous and expansive like a genie just liberated from her bottle And my spirit soared free like a great whale gliding through the sea of silent euphoria Nirvana I found Nirvana And I remember thinking theres no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body But then I realized But Im still alive Im still alive and I have found Nirvana And if I have found Nirvana and Im still alive then everyone who is alive can find Nirvana And I pictured a world filled with beautiful peaceful compassionate loving people who knew that they could come to this space at any time And that they could purposely choose to step to the right of their left hemispheres  and find this peace And then I realized what a tremendous gift this experience could be what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives And it motivated me to recover Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage the surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers Here I am with my mama who is a true angel in my life It took me eight years to completely recover So who are we We are the lifeforce power of the universe with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds And we have the power to choose moment by moment who and how we want to be in the world Right here right now I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere where we are I am the lifeforce power of the universe I am the lifeforce power of the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form at one with all that is Or I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere where I become a single individual a solid Separate from the flow separate from you I am Dr Jill Bolte Taylor intellectual neuroanatomist These are the we inside of me Which would you choose Which do you choose And when I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep innerpeace circuitry of our right hemispheres the more peace we will project into the world and the more peaceful our planet will be And I thought that was an idea worth spreading Thank youThe story starts I was at a friends house and she had on her shelf a copy of the DSM manual which is the manual of mental disorders It lists every known mental disorder And it used to be back in the 50s a very slim pamphlet And then it got bigger and bigger and bigger and now its 886 pages long And it lists currently 374 mental disorders So I was leafing through it wondering if I had any mental disorders and it turns out Ive got 12 Ive got generalized anxiety disorder which is a given Ive got nightmare disorder which is categorized if you have recurrent dreams of being pursued or declared a failure and all my dreams involve people chasing me down the street going Youre a failure Ive got parentchild relational problems which I blame my parents for Im kidding Im not kidding Im kidding And Ive got malingering And I think its actually quite rare to have both malingering and generalized anxiety disorder because malingering tends to make me feel very anxious Anyway I was looking through this book wondering if I was much crazier than I thought I was or maybe its not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder if youre not a trained professional or maybe the psychiatry profession has a kind of strange desire to label whats essentially normal human behavior as a mental disorder I didnt know which of these was true but I thought it was kind of interesting and I thought maybe I should meet a critic of psychiatry to get their view which is how I ended up having lunch with the Scientologists It was a man called Brian who runs a crack team of Scientologists who are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies Theyre called the CCHR And I said to him Can you prove to me that psychiatry is a pseudoscience that cant be trusted And he said Yes we can prove it to you And I said How And he said Were going to introduce you to Tony And I said Whos Tony And he said Tonys in Broadmoor Now Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital It used to be known as the Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane Its where they send the serial killers and the people who cant help themselves And I said to Brian Well what did Tony do And he said Hardly anything He beat someone up or something and he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence But he faked it too well and now hes stuck in Broadmoor and nobody will believe hes sane Do you want us to try and get you into Broadmoor to meet Tony So I said Yes please So I got the train to Broadmoor I began to yawn uncontrollably around Kempton Park which apparently is what dogs also do when anxious they yawn uncontrollably And we got to Broadmoor And I got taken through gate after gate after gate after gate into the wellness center which is where you get to meet the patients It looks like a giant Hampton Inn Its all peach and pine and calming colors And the only bold colors are the reds of the panic buttons And the patients started drifting in And they were quite overweight and wearing sweatpants and quite docilelooking And Brian the Scientologist whispered to me Theyre medicated which to the Scientologists is like the worst evil in the world but Im thinking its probably a good idea And then Brian said Heres Tony And a man was walking in And he wasnt overweight he was in very good physical shape And he wasnt wearing sweatpants he was wearing a pinstripe suit And he had his arm outstretched like someone out of The Apprentice He looked like a man who wanted to wear an outfit that would convince me that he was very sane And he sat down And I said So is it true that you faked your way in here And he said Yep Yep Absolutely I beat someone up when I was 17 And I was in prison awaiting trial and my cellmate said to me You know what you have to do Fake madness Tell them youre mad youll get sent to some cushy hospital Nurses will bring you pizzas youll have your own PlayStation I said Well how did you do it He said Well I asked to see the prison psychiatrist And Id just seen a film called Crash in which people get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls So I said to the psychiatrist I get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls And I said What else He said Oh yeah I told the psychiatrist that I wanted to watch women as they died because it would make me feel more normal I said Whered you get that from He said Oh from a biography of Ted Bundy that they had at the prison library Anyway he faked madness too well he said And they didnt send him to some cushy hospital They sent him to Broadmoor And the minute he got there said he took one look at the place asked to see the psychiatrist said Theres been a terrible misunderstanding Im not mentally ill I said How long have you been here for He said Well if Id just done my time in prison for the original crime Id have got five years Ive been in Broadmoor for 12 years Tony said that its a lot harder to convince people youre sane than it is to convince them youre crazy He said I thought the best way to seem normal would be to talk to people normally about normal things like football or whats on TV I subscribe to New Scientist and recently they had an article about how the US Army was training bumblebees to sniff out explosives So I said to a nurse Did you know that the US Army is training bumblebees to sniff out explosives When I read my medical notes I saw theyd written Believes bees can sniff out explosives He said You know theyre always looking out for nonverbal clues to my mental state But how do you sit in a sane way How do you cross your legs in a sane way Its just impossible When Tony said that to me I thought to myself Am I sitting like a journalist Am I crossing my legs like a journalist He said You know Ive got the Stockwell Strangler on one side of me and Ive got the Tiptoe Through the Tulips rapist on the other side of me So I tend to stay in my room a lot because I find them quite frightening And they take that as a sign of madness They say it proves that Im aloof and grandiose So only in Broadmoor would not wanting to hang out with serial killers be a sign of madness Anyway he seemed completely normal to me but what did I know And when I got home I emailed his clinician Anthony Maden I said Whats the story And he said Yep We accept that Tony faked madness to get out of a prison sentence because his hallucinations  that had seemed quite cliche to begin with  just vanished the minute he got to Broadmoor However we have assessed him and weve determined that what he is is a psychopath And in fact faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath Its on the checklist cunning manipulative So faking your brain going wrong is evidence that your brain has gone wrong And I spoke to other experts and they said the pinstripe suit  classic psychopath  speaks to items one and two on the checklist glibness superficial charm and grandiose sense of selfworth And I said Well but why didnt he hang out with the other patients Classic psychopath  it speaks to grandiosity and also lack of empathy So all the things that had seemed most normal about Tony was evidence according to his clinician that he was mad in this new way He was a psychopath And his clinician said to me If you want to know more about psychopaths you can go on a psychopathspotting course run by Robert Hare who invented the psychopath checklist So I did I went on a psychopathspotting course and I am now a certified  and I have to say extremely adept  psychopath spotter So heres the statistics One in a hundred regular people is a psychopath So theres 1500 people in his room Fifteen of you are psychopaths Although that figure rises to four percent of CEOs and business leaders so I think theres a very good chance theres about 30 or 40 psychopaths in this room It could be carnage by the end of the night Hare said the reason why is because capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior  the lack of empathy the glibness cunning manipulative In fact capitalism perhaps at its most remorseless is a physical manifestation of psychopathy Its like a form of psychopathy thats come down to affect us all Hare said You know what Forget about some guy at Broadmoor who may or may not have faked madness Who cares Thats not a big story The big story he said is corporate psychopathy You want to go and interview yourself some corporate psychopaths So I gave it a try I wrote to the Enron people I said Could I come and interview you in prison to find out it youre psychopaths And they didnt reply So I changed tack I emailed Chainsaw Al Dunlap the asset stripper from the 1990s He would come into failing businesses and close down 30 percent of the workforce just turn American towns into ghost towns And I emailed him and I said I believe you may have a very special brain anomaly that makes you  special and interested in the predatory spirit and fearless Can I come and interview you about your special brain anomaly And he said Come on over So I went to Al Dunlaps grand Florida mansion It was filled with sculptures of predatory animals There were lions and tigers  he was taking me through the garden  there were falcons and eagles he was saying Over there youve got sharks and  he was saying this in a less effeminate way  Youve got more sharks and youve got tigers It was like Narnia And then we went into his kitchen Now Al Dunlap would be brought in to save failing companies hed close down 30 percent of the workforce And hed quite often fire people with a joke Like for instance one famous story about him somebody came up to him and said Ive just bought myself a new car And he said Well you may have a new car but Ill tell you what you dont have  a job So in his kitchen  he was in there with his wife Judy and his bodyguard Sean  and I said You know how I said in my email that you might have a special brain anomaly that makes you special He said Yeah its an amazing theory its like Star Trek Youre going where no man has gone before And I said Well  Some psychologists might say that this makes you  And he said What And I said A psychopath And I said Ive got a list of psychopathic traits in my pocket Can I go through them with you And he looked intrigued despite himself and he said Okay go on And I said Okay Grandiose sense of selfworth Which I have to say would have been hard for him to deny because he was standing under a giant oil painting of himself He said Well youve got to believe in you And I said Manipulative He said Thats leadership And I said Shallow affect an inability to experience a range of emotions He said Who wants to be weighed down by some nonsense emotions So he was going down the psychopath checklist basically turning it into Who Moved My Cheese But I did notice something happening to me the day I was with Al Dunlap Whenever he said anything to me that was kind of normal  like he said no to juvenile delinquency he said he got accepted into West Point and they dont let delinquents in West Point He said no to many shortterm marital relationships Hes only ever been married twice Admittedly his first wife cited in her divorce papers that he once threatened her with a knife and said he always wondered what human flesh tasted like but people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages in the heat of an argument and his second marriage has lasted 41 years So whenever he said anything to me that just seemed kind of nonpsychopathic I thought to myself well Im not going to put that in my book And then I realized that becoming a psychopath spotter had kind of turned me a little bit psychopathic Because I was desperate to shove him in a box marked Psychopath I was desperate to define him by his maddest edges And I realized my God  this is what Ive been doing for 20 years Its what all journalists do We travel across the world with our notepads in our hands and we wait for the gems And the gems are always the outermost aspects of our interviewees personality And we stitch them together like medieval monks and we leave the normal stuff on the floor And you know this is a country that overdiagnoses certain mental disorders hugely Childhood bipolar  children as young as four are being labeled bipolar because they have temper tantrums which scores them high on the bipolar checklist When I got back to London Tony phoned me He said Why havent you been returning my calls I said Well they say that youre a psychopath And he said Im not a psychopath He said You know what One of the items on the checklist is lack of remorse but another item on the checklist is cunning manipulative So when you say you feel remorse for your crime they say Typical of the psychopath to cunningly say he feels remorse when he doesnt Its like witchcraft they turn everything upsidedown He said Ive got a tribunal coming up Will you come to it So I said okay So I went to his tribunal And after 14 years in Broadmoor they let him go They decided that he shouldnt be held indefinitely because he scores high on a checklist that might mean that he would have a greater than average chance of recidivism So they let him go And outside in the corridor he said to me You know what Jon Everyones a bit psychopathic He said You are I am Well obviously I am I said What are you going to do now He said Im going to go to Belgium Theres a woman there that I fancy But shes married so Im going to have to get her split up from her husband Anyway that was two years ago and thats where my book ended And for the last 20 months everything was fine Nothing bad happened He was living with a girl outside London He was according to Brian the Scientologist making up for lost time which I know sounds ominous but isnt necessarily ominous Unfortunately after 20 months he did go back to jail for a month He got into a fracas in a bar he called it Ended up going to jail for a month which I know is bad but at least a month implies that whatever the fracas was it wasnt too bad And then he phoned me And you know what I think its right that Tony is out Because you shouldnt define people by their maddest edges And what Tony is is hes a semipsychopath Hes a gray area in a world that doesnt like gray areas But the gray areas are where you find the complexity Its where you find the humanity and its where you find the truth And Tony said to me Jon could I buy you a drink in a bar I just want to thank you for everything youve done for me And I didnt go What would you have done Thank youAs a magician I try to create images that make people stop and think I also try to challenge myself to do things that doctors say are not possible I was buried alive in New York City in a coffin buried alive in a coffin in April 1999 for a week I lived there with nothing but water And it ended up being so much fun that I decided I could pursue doing more of these things The next one is I froze myself in a block of ice for three days and three nights in New York City That one was way more difficult than I had expected The one after that I stood on top of a hundredfoot pillar for 36 hours I began to hallucinate so hard that the buildings that were behind me started to look like big animal heads So next I went to London In London I lived in a glass box for 44 days with nothing but water It was for me one of the most difficult things Id ever done but it was also the most beautiful There was so many skeptics especially the press in London that they started flying cheeseburgers on helicopters around my box to tempt me So I felt very validated when the New England Journal of Medicine actually used the research for science My next pursuit was I wanted to see how long I could go without breathing like how long I could survive with nothing not even air I didnt realize that it would become the most amazing journey of my life As a young magician I was obsessed with Houdini and his underwater challenges So I began early on competing against the other kids seeing how long I could stay underwater while they went up and down to breathe you know five times while I stayed under on one breath By the time I was a teenager I was able to hold my breath for three minutes and 30 seconds I would later find out that was Houdinis personal record In 1987 I heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river He was underneath not breathing for 45 minutes When the rescue workers came they resuscitated him and there was no brain damage His core temperature had dropped to 77 degrees As a magician I think everything is possible And I think if something is done by one person it can be done by others I started to think if the boy could survive without breathing for that long there must be a way that I could do it So I met with a top neurosurgeon And I asked him how long is it possible to go without breathing like how long could I go without air And he said to me that anything over six minutes you have a serious risk of hypoxic brain damage So I took that as a challenge basically My first try I figured that I could do something similar and I created a water tank and I filled it with ice and freezing cold water And I stayed inside of that water tank hoping my core temperature would start to drop And I was shivering In my first attempt to hold my breath I couldnt even last a minute So I realized that was completely not going to work I went to talk to a doctor friend  and I asked him How could I do that I want to hold my breath for a really long time How could it be done And he said David youre a magician create the illusion of not breathing it will be much easier So he came up with this idea of creating a rebreather with a CO2 scrubber which was basically a tube from Home Depot with a balloon ducttaped to it that he thought we could put inside of me and somehow be able to circulate the air and rebreathe with this thing in me This is a little hard to watch But this is that attempt So that clearly wasnt going to work Then I actually started thinking about liquid breathing There is a chemical thats called perflubron And its so high in oxygen levels that in theory you could breathe it So I got my hands on that chemical filled the sink up with it and stuck my face in the sink and tried to breathe that in which was really impossible Its basically like trying to breathe as a doctor said while having an elephant standing on your chest So that idea disappeared Then I started thinking would it be possible to hook up a heartlung bypass machine and have a surgery where it was a tube going into my artery and then appear to not breathe while they were oxygenating my blood Which was another insane idea obviously Then I thought about the craziest idea of all the ideas to actually do it To actually try to hold my breath past the point that doctors would consider you brain dead So I started researching into pearl divers You know because they go down for four minutes on one breath And when I was researching pearl divers I found the world of freediving It was the most amazing thing that I ever discovered pretty much There is many different aspects to freediving There is depth records where people go as deep as they can And then there is static apnea Thats holding your breath as long as you can in one place without moving That was the one that I studied The first thing that I learned is when youre holding your breath you should never move at all that wastes energy And that depletes oxygen and it builds up CO2 in your blood So I learned never to move And I learned how to slow my heart rate down I had to remain perfectly still and just relax and think that I wasnt in my body and just control that And then I learned how to purge Purging is basically hyperventilating You blow in and out  You do that you get lightheaded you get tingling And youre really ridding your body of CO2 So when you hold your breath its infinitely easier Then I learned that you have to take a huge breath and just hold and relax and never let any air out and just hold and relax through all the pain Every morning this is for months I would wake up and the first thing that I would do is I would hold my breath for out of 52 minutes I would hold my breath for 44 minutes So basically what that means is I would purge Id breathe really hard for a minute And I would hold immediately after for five and a half minutes Then I would breathe again for a minute purging as hard as I can then immediately after that I would hold again for five and a half minutes I would repeat this process eight times in a row Out of 52 minutes youre only breathing for eight minutes At the end of that youre completely fried your brain You feel like youre walking around in a daze And you have these awful headaches Basically Im not the best person to talk to when Im doing that stuff I started learning about the worldrecord holder His name is Tom Sietas And this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath Hes six foot four Hes 160 pounds And his total lung capacity is twice the size of an average person Im six foot one and fat Well say bigboned I had to drop 50 pounds in three months So everything that I put into my body I considered as medicine Every bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value I ate really small controlled portions throughout the day And I started to really adapt my body Individual results may vary The thinner I was the longer I was able to hold my breath And by eating so well and training so hard my resting heartrate dropped to 38 beats per minute Which is lower than most Olympic athletes In four months of training I was able to hold my breath for over seven minutes I wanted to try holding my breath everywhere I wanted to try it in the most extreme situations to see if I could slow my heart rate down under duress I decided that I was going to break the world record live on primetime television The world record was eight minutes and 58 seconds held by Tom Sietas that guy with the whale lungs I told you about I assumed that I could put a water tank at Lincoln Center and if I stayed there a week not eating I would get comfortable in that situation and I would slow my metabolism which I was sure would help me hold my breath longer than I had been able to do it I was completely wrong I entered the sphere a week before the scheduled air date And I thought everything seemed to be on track Two days before my big breathhold attempt for the record the producers of my television special thought that just watching somebody holding their breath and almost drowning is too boring for television So I had to add handcuffs while holding my breath to escape from This was a critical mistake Because of the movement I was wasting oxygen And by seven minutes I had gone into these awful convulsions By 708 I started to black out And by seven minutes and 30 seconds they had to pull my body out and bring me back I had failed on every level So naturally the only way out of the slump that I could think of was I decided to call Oprah I told her that I wanted to up the ante and hold my breath longer than any human being ever had This was a different record This was a pure O2 static apnea record that Guinness had set the world record at 13 minutes So basically you breathe pure O2 first oxygenating your body flushing out CO2 and you are able to hold much longer I realized that my real competition was the beaver In January of 08 Oprah gave me four months to prepare and train So I would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night A hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates altitude at 15000 feet So its like base camp Everest What that does is you start building up the red bloodcell count in your body which helps you carry oxygen better Every morning again after getting out of that tent your brain is completely wiped out My first attempt on pure O2 I was able to go up to 15 minutes So it was a pretty big success The neurosurgeon pulled me out of the water because in his mind at 15 minutes your brain is done youre brain dead So he pulled me up and I was fine There was one person there that was definitely not impressed It was my exgirlfriend While I was breaking the record underwater for the first time she was sifting through my Blackberry checking all my messages My brother had a picture of it It is really  I then announced that I was going to go for Sietas record publicly And what he did in response is he went on Regis and Kelly and broke his old record Then his main competitor went out and broke his record So he suddenly pushed the record up to 16 minutes and 32 seconds Which was three minutes longer than I had prepared It was longer than the record I wanted to get the Science Times to document this I wanted to get them to do a piece on it So I did what any person seriously pursuing scientific advancement would do I walked into the New York Times offices and did card tricks to everybody So I dont know if it was the magic or the lure of the Cayman Islands but John Tierney flew down and did a piece on the seriousness of breathholding While he was there I tried to impress him of course And I did a dive down to 160 feet which is basically the height of a 16 story building and as I was coming up I blacked out underwater which is really dangerous thats how you drown Luckily Kirk had seen me and he swam over and pulled me up So I started full focus I completely trained to get my breathhold time up for what I needed to do But there was no way to prepare for the live television aspect of it being on Oprah But in practice I would do it face down floating on the pool But for TV they wanted me to be upright so they could see my face basically The other problem was the suit was so buoyant that they had to strap my feet in to keep me from floating up So I had to use my legs to hold my feet into the straps that were loose which was a real problem for me That made me extremely nervous raising the heart rate Then what they also did was which we never did before is there was a heartrate monitor And it was right next to the sphere So every time my heart would beat Id hear the beepbeepbeepbeep you know the ticking really loud Which was making me more nervous And there was no way to slow my heart rate down Normally I would start at 38 beats per minute and while holding my breath it would drop to 12 beats per minute which is pretty unusual This time it started at 120 beats and it never went down I spent the first five minutes underwater desperately trying to slow my heart rate down I was just sitting there thinking Ive got to slow this down Im going to fail And I was getting more nervous And the heart rate just kept going up and up all the way up to 150 beats Basically its the same thing that created my downfall at Lincoln Center It was a waste of O2 When I made it to the halfway mark at eight minutes I was 100 percent certain that I was not going to be able to make this There was no way for me to do it I figured Oprah had dedicated an hour to doing this breathhold thing if I had cracked early it would be a whole show about how depressed I am So I figured Im better off just fighting and staying there until I black out at least then they can pull me out and take care of me and all that I kept pushing to 10 minutes At 10 minutes you start getting all these really strong tingling sensations in your fingers and toes And I knew that that was blood shunting when the blood rushes away from your extremities to provide oxygen to your vital organs At 11 minutes I started feeling throbbing sensations in my legs and my lips started to feel really strange At minute 12 I started to have ringing in my ears and I started to feel my arm going numb And Im a hypochondriac and I remember arm numb means heart attack So I started to really get really paranoid Then at 13 minutes maybe because of the hypochondria I started feeling pains all over my chest It was awful At 14 minutes I had these awful contractions like this urge to breathe At 15 minutes I was suffering major O2 deprivation to the heart And I started having ischemia to the heart My heartbeat would go from 120 to 50 to 150 to 40 to 20 to 150 again It would skip a beat It would start It would stop And I felt all this And I was sure that I was going to have a heart attack So at 16 minutes what I did is I slid my feet out because I knew that if I did go out if I did have a heart attack theyd have to jump into the binding and take my feet out before pulling me up I was really nervous I let my feet out and I started floating to the top And I didnt take my head out But I was just floating there waiting for my heart to stop just waiting They had doctors with the Pst you know sitting there waiting And then suddenly I hear screaming And I think that there is some weird thing  that I had died or something had happened And then I realized that I had made it to  So with the energy of everybody that was there I decided to keep pushing And I went to 17 minutes and four seconds As though that wasnt enough what I did immediately after is I went to Quest Labs and had them take every blood sample that they could to test for everything and to see where my levels were so the doctors could use it once again I also didnt want anybody to question it I had the world record and I wanted to make sure it was legitimate So I get to New York City the next day Im walking out of the Apple store and this kid walks up to me hes like Yo D Im like Yeah He said If you really held your breath that long whyd you come out of the water dry I was like What And thats my life So  As a magician I try to show things to people that seem impossible And I think magic whether Im holding my breath or shuffling a deck of cards is pretty simple Its practice its training and its  Its practice its training and experimenting while pushing through the pain to be the best that I can be And thats what magic is to me so thank youYoure looking at a woman who was publicly silent for a decade Obviously thats changed but only recently It was several months ago that I gave my very first major public talk at the Forbes 30 Under 30 Summit  1500 brilliant people all under the age of 30 That meant that in 1998 the oldest among the group were only 14 and the youngest just four I joked with them that some might only have heard of me from rap songs Yes Im in rap songs Almost 40 rap songs But the night of my speech a surprising thing happened At the age of 41 I was hit on by a 27yearold guy I know right He was charming and I was flattered and I declined You know what his unsuccessful pickup line was He could make me feel 22 again I realized later that night Im probably the only person over 40 who does not want to be 22 again At the age of 22 I fell in love with my boss And at the age of 24 I learned the devastating consequences Can I see a show of hands of anyone here who didnt make a mistake or do something they regretted at 22 Yep Thats what I thought So like me at 22 a few of you may have also taken wrong turns and fallen in love with the wrong person maybe even your boss Unlike me though your boss probably wasnt the president of the United States of America Of course life is full of surprises Not a day goes by that Im not reminded of my mistake and I regret that mistake deeply In 1998 after having been swept up into an improbable romance I was then swept up into the eye of a political legal and media maelstrom like we had never seen before Remember just a few years earlier news was consumed from just three places reading a newspaper or magazine listening to the radio or watching television That was it But that wasnt my fate Instead this scandal was brought to you by the digital revolution That meant we could access all the information we wanted when we wanted it anytime anywhere And when the story broke in January 1998 it broke online It was the first time the traditional news was usurped by the internet for a major news story  a click that reverberated around the world What that meant for me personally was that overnight I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one worldwide I was patient zero of losing a personal reputation on a global scale almost instantaneously This rush to judgment enabled by technology led to mobs of virtual stonethrowers Granted it was before social media but people could still comment online email stories and of course email cruel jokes News sources plastered photos of me all over to sell newspapers banner ads online and to keep people tuned to the TV Do you recall a particular image of me say wearing a beret Now I admit I made mistakes  especially wearing that beret But the attention and judgment that I received  not the story but that I personally received  was unprecedented I was branded as a tramp tart slut whore bimbo and of course that woman I was seen by many but actually known by few And I get it it was easy to forget that that woman was dimensional had a soul and was once unbroken When this happened to me 17 years ago there was no name for it Now we call it cyberbullying and online harassment Today I want to share some of my experience with you talk about how that experience has helped shape my cultural observations and how I hope my past experience can lead to a change that results in less suffering for others In 1998 I lost my reputation and my dignity I lost almost everything And I almost lost my life Let me paint a picture for you It is September of 1998 Im sitting in a windowless office room inside the Office of the Independent Counsel underneath humming fluorescent lights Im listening to the sound of my voice my voice on surreptitiously taped phone calls that a supposed friend had made the year before Im here because Ive been legally required to personally authenticate all 20 hours of taped conversation For the past eight months the mysterious content of these tapes has hung like the sword of Damocles over my head I mean who can remember what they said a year ago Scared and mortified I listen listen as I prattle on about the flotsam and jetsam of the day listen as I confess my love for the president and of course my heartbreak listen to my sometimes catty sometimes churlish sometimes silly self being cruel unforgiving uncouth listen deeply deeply ashamed to the worst version of myself a self I dont even recognize A few days later the Starr Report is released to Congress and all of those tapes and transcripts those stolen words form a part of it That people can read the transcripts is horrific enough But a few weeks later the audiotapes are aired on TV and significant portions made available online The public humiliation was excruciating Life was almost unbearable This was not something that happened with regularity back then in 1998 and by this I mean the stealing of peoples private words actions conversations or photos and then making them public  public without consent public without context and public without compassion Fastforward 12 years to 2010 and now social media has been born The landscape has sadly become much more populated with instances like mine whether or not someone actually made a mistake and now its for both public and private people The consequences for some have become dire very dire I was on the phone with my mom in September of 2010 and we were talking about the news of a young college freshman from Rutgers University named Tyler Clementi Sweet sensitive creative Tyler was secretly webcammed by his roommate while being intimate with another man When the online world learned of this incident the ridicule and cyberbullying ignited A few days later Tyler jumped from the George Washington Bridge to his death He was 18 My mom was beside herself about what happened to Tyler and his family and she was gutted with pain in a way that I just couldnt quite understand And then eventually I realized she was reliving 1998 reliving a time when she sat by my bed every night reliving  sorry  reliving a time when she made me shower with the bathroom door open and reliving a time when both of my parents feared that I would be humiliated to death literally Today too many parents havent had the chance to step in and rescue their loved ones Too many have learned of their childs suffering and humiliation after it was too late Tylers tragic senseless death was a turning point for me It served to recontextualize my experiences and I then began to look at the world of humiliation and bullying around me and see something different In 1998 we had no way of knowing where this brave new technology called the internet would take us Since then it has connected people in unimaginable ways  joining lost siblings saving lives launching revolutions  But the darkness cyberbullying and slutshaming that I experienced had mushroomed Every day online people  especially young people who are not developmentally equipped to handle this  are so abused and humiliated that they cant imagine living to the next day And some tragically dont And theres nothing virtual about that Childline a UK nonprofit thats focused on helping young people on various issues released a staggering statistic late last year from 2012 to 2013 there was an 87 percent increase in calls and emails related to cyberbullying A metaanalysis done out of the Netherlands showed that for the first time cyberbullying was leading to suicidal ideations more significantly than offline bullying And you know what shocked me  although it shouldnt have  was other research last year that determined humiliation was a more intensely felt emotion than either happiness or even anger Cruelty to others is nothing new But online technologically enhanced shaming is amplified uncontained and permanently accessible The echo of embarrassment used to extend only as far as your family village school or community But now its the online community too Millions of people often anonymously can stab you with their words and thats a lot of pain And there are no perimeters around how many people can publicly observe you and put you in a public stockade There is a very personal price to public humiliation and the growth of the internet has jacked up that price For nearly two decades now we have slowly been sowing the seeds of shame and public humiliation in our cultural soil both on and offline Gossip websites paparazzi reality programming politics news outlets and sometimes hackers all traffic in shame Its led to desensitization and a permissive environment online which lends itself to trolling invasion of privacy and cyberbullying This shift has created what Professor Nicolaus Mills calls a culture of humiliation Consider a few prominent examples just from the past six months alone Snapchat the service which is used mainly by younger generations and claims that its messages only have the life span of a few seconds You can imagine the range of content that that gets A thirdparty app which Snapchatters use to preserve the life span of the messages was hacked and 100000 personal conversations photos and videos were leaked online to now have a life span of forever Jennifer Lawrence and several other actors had their iCloud accounts hacked and private intimate nude photos were plastered across the internet without their permission One gossip website had over five million hits for this one story And what about the Sony Pictures cyberhacking The documents which received the most attention were private emails that had maximum public embarrassment value But in this culture of humiliation there is another kind of price tag attached to public shaming The price does not measure the cost to the victim which Tyler and too many others  notably women minorities and members of the LGBTQ community  have paid but the price measures the profit of those who prey on them This invasion of others is a raw material efficiently and ruthlessly mined packaged and sold at a profit A marketplace has emerged where public humiliation is a commodity and shame is an industry How is the money made Clicks The more shame the more clicks The more clicks the more advertising dollars Were in a dangerous cycle The more we click on this kind of gossip the more numb we get to the human lives behind it And the more numb we get the more we click All the while someone is making money off of the back of someone elses suffering With every click we make a choice The more we saturate our culture with public shaming the more accepted it is the more we will see behavior like cyberbullying trolling some forms of hacking and online harassment Why Because they all have humiliation at their cores This behavior is a symptom of the culture weve created Just think about it Changing behavior begins with evolving beliefs Weve seen that to be true with racism homophobia and plenty of other biases today and in the past As weve changed beliefs about samesex marriage more people have been offered equal freedoms When we began valuing sustainability more people began to recycle So as far as our culture of humiliation goes what we need is a cultural revolution Public shaming as a blood sport has to stop and its time for an intervention on the internet and in our culture The shift begins with something simple but its not easy We need to return to a longheld value of compassion compassion and empathy Online weve got a compassion deficit an empathy crisis Researcher Brené Brown said and I quote Shame cant survive empathy Shame cannot survive empathy Ive seen some very dark days in my life It was the compassion and empathy from my family friends professionals and sometimes even strangers that saved me Even empathy from one person can make a difference The theory of minority influence proposed by social psychologist Serge Moscovici says that even in small numbers when theres consistency over time change can happen In the online world we can foster minority influence by becoming upstanders To become an upstander means instead of bystander apathy we can post a positive comment for someone or report a bullying situation Trust me compassionate comments help abate the negativity We can also counteract the culture by supporting organizations that deal with these kinds of issues like the Tyler Clementi Foundation in the US in the UK theres AntiBullying Pro and in Australia theres PROJECT ROCKIT We talk a lot about our right to freedom of expression But we need to talk more about our responsibility to freedom of expression We all want to be heard but lets acknowledge the difference between speaking up with intention and speaking up for attention The internet is the superhighway for the id But online showing empathy to others benefits us all and helps create a safer and better world We need to communicate online with compassion consume news with compassion and click with compassion Just imagine walking a mile in someone elses headline Id like to end on a personal note In the past nine months the question Ive been asked the most is Why Why now Why was I sticking my head above the parapet You can read between the lines in those questions and the answer has nothing to do with politics The topnote answer was and is Because its time Time to stop tiptoeing around my past time to stop living a life of opprobrium and time to take back my narrative Its also not just about saving myself Anyone who is suffering from shame and public humiliation needs to know one thing You can survive it I know its hard It may not be painless quick or easy but you can insist on a different ending to your story Have compassion for yourself We all deserve compassion and to live both online and off in a more compassionate world Thank you for listeningThank you very much Well I would like to start with testicles Men who sleep five hours a night have significantly smaller testicles than those who sleep seven hours or more footnote footnote In addition men who routinely sleep just four to five hours a night will have a level of testosterone which is that of someone 10 years their senior So a lack of sleep will age a man by a decade in terms of that critical aspect of wellness And we see equivalent impairments in female reproductive health caused by a lack of sleep This is the best news that I have for you today From this point it may only get worse Not only will I tell you about the wonderfully good things that happen when you get sleep but the alarmingly bad things that happen when you dont get enough both for your brain and for your body Let me start with the brain and the functions of learning and memory because what weve discovered over the past 10 or so years is that you need sleep after learning to essentially hit the save button on those new memories so that you dont forget But recently we discovered that you also need sleep before learning to actually prepare your brain almost like a dry sponge ready to initially soak up new information And without sleep the memory circuits of the brain essentially become waterlogged as it were and you cant absorb new memories footnote footnote So let me show you the data Here in this study we decided to test the hypothesis that pulling the allnighter was a good idea So we took a group of individuals and we assigned them to one of two experimental groups a sleep group and a sleep deprivation group Now the sleep group theyre going to get a full eight hours of slumber but the deprivation group were going to keep them awake in the laboratory under full supervision Theres no naps or caffeine by the way so its miserable for everyone involved And then the next day were going to place those participants inside an MRI scanner and were going to have them try and learn a whole list of new facts as were taking snapshots of brain activity And then were going to test them to see how effective that learning has been And thats what youre looking at here on the vertical axis And when you put those two groups head to head what you find is a quite significant 40percent deficit in the ability of the brain to make new memories without sleep I think this should be concerning considering what we know is happening to sleep in our education populations right now In fact to put that in context it would be the difference in a child acing an exam versus failing it miserably  40 percent And weve gone on to discover what goes wrong within your brain to produce these types of learning disabilities And theres a structure that sits on the left and the right side of your brain called the hippocampus And you can think of the hippocampus almost like the informational inbox of your brain Its very good at receiving new memory files and then holding on to them And when you look at this structure in those people whod had a full night of sleep we saw lots of healthy learningrelated activity Yet in those people who were sleepdeprived we actually couldnt find any significant signal whatsoever So its almost as though sleep deprivation had shut down your memory inbox and any new incoming files  they were just being bounced You couldnt effectively commit new experiences to memory So thats the bad that can happen if I were to take sleep away from you but let me just come back to that control group for a second Do you remember those folks that got a full eight hours of sleep Well we can ask a very different question What is it about the physiological quality of your sleep when you do get it that restores and enhances your memory and learning ability each and every day And by placing electrodes all over the head what weve discovered is that there are big powerful brainwaves that happen during the very deepest stages of sleep that have riding on top of them these spectacular bursts of electrical activity that we call sleep spindles And its the combined quality of these deepsleep brainwaves that acts like a filetransfer mechanism at night shifting memories from a shortterm vulnerable reservoir to a more permanent longterm storage site within the brain and therefore protecting them making them safe And it is important that we understand what during sleep actually transacts these memory benefits because there are real medical and societal implications And let me just tell you about one area that weve moved this work out into clinically which is the context of aging and dementia Because its of course no secret that as we get older our learning and memory abilities begin to fade and decline But what weve also discovered is that a physiological signature of aging is that your sleep gets worse especially that deep quality of sleep that I was just discussing And only last year we finally published evidence that these two things theyre not simply cooccurring they are significantly interrelated And it suggests that the disruption of deep sleep is an underappreciated factor that is contributing to cognitive decline or memory decline in aging and most recently weve discovered in Alzheimers disease as well Now I know this is remarkably depressing news Its in the mail Its coming at you But theres a potential silver lining here Unlike many of the other factors that we know are associated with aging for example changes in the physical structure of the brain thats fiendishly difficult to treat But that sleep is a missing piece in the explanatory puzzle of aging and Alzheimers is exciting because we may be able to do something about it And one way that we are approaching this at my sleep center is not by using sleeping pills by the way Unfortunately they are blunt instruments that do not produce naturalistic sleep Instead were actually developing a method based on this Its called direct current brain stimulation You insert a small amount of voltage into the brain so small you typically dont feel it but it has a measurable impact Now if you apply this stimulation during sleep in young healthy adults as if youre sort of singing in time with those deepsleep brainwaves not only can you amplify the size of those deepsleep brainwaves but in doing so we can almost double the amount of memory benefit that you get from sleep The question now is whether we can translate this same affordable potentially portable piece of technology into older adults and those with dementia Can we restore back some healthy quality of deep sleep and in doing so can we salvage aspects of their learning and memory function That is my real hope now Thats one of our moonshot goals as it were footnote footnote So thats an example of sleep for your brain but sleep is just as essential for your body Weve already spoken about sleep loss and your reproductive system Or I could tell you about sleep loss and your cardiovascular system and that all it takes is one hour Because there is a global experiment performed on 16 billion people across 70 countries twice a year and its called daylight saving time Now in the spring when we lose one hour of sleep we see a subsequent 24percent increase in heart attacks that following day In the autumn when we gain an hour of sleep we see a 21percent reduction in heart attacks Isnt that incredible And you see exactly the same profile for car crashes road traffic accidents even suicide rates But as a deeper dive I want to focus on this sleep loss and your immune system And here Ill introduce these delightful blue elements in the image They are called natural killer cells and you can think of natural killer cells almost like the secret service agents of your immune system They are very good at identifying dangerous unwanted elements and eliminating them In fact what theyre doing here is destroying a cancerous tumor mass So what you wish for is a virile set of these immune assassins at all times and tragically thats what you dont have if youre not sleeping enough footnote footnote So here in this experiment youre not going to have your sleep deprived for an entire night youre simply going to have your sleep restricted to four hours for one single night and then were going to look to see whats the percent reduction in immune cell activity that you suffer And its not small  its not 10 percent its not 20 percent There was a 70percent drop in natural killer cell activity Thats a concerning state of immune deficiency and you can perhaps understand why were now finding significant links between short sleep duration and your risk for the development of numerous forms of cancer Currently that list includes cancer of the bowel cancer of the prostate and cancer of the breast In fact the link between a lack of sleep and cancer is now so strong that the World Health Organization has classified any form of nighttime shift work as a probable carcinogen because of a disruption of your sleepwake rhythms So you may have heard of that old maxim that you can sleep when youre dead Well Im being quite serious now  it is mortally unwise advice We know this from epidemiological studies across millions of individuals Theres a simple truth the shorter your sleep the shorter your life Short sleep predicts allcause mortality And if increasing your risk for the development of cancer or even Alzheimers disease were not sufficiently disquieting we have since discovered that a lack of sleep will even erode the very fabric of biological life itself your DNA genetic code So here in this study they took a group of healthy adults and they limited them to six hours of sleep a night for one week and then they measured the change in their gene activity profile relative to when those same individuals were getting a full eight hours of sleep a night And there were two critical findings First a sizable and significant 711 genes were distorted in their activity caused by a lack of sleep The second result was that about half of those genes were actually increased in their activity The other half were decreased Now those genes that were switched off by a lack of sleep were genes associated with your immune system so once again you can see that immune deficiency In contrast those genes that were actually upregulated or increased by way of a lack of sleep were genes associated with the promotion of tumors genes associated with longterm chronic inflammation within the body and genes associated with stress and as a consequence cardiovascular disease There is simply no aspect of your wellness that can retreat at the sign of sleep deprivation and get away unscathed Its rather like a broken water pipe in your home Sleep loss will leak down into every nook and cranny of your physiology even tampering with the very DNA nucleic alphabet that spells out your daily health narrative And at this point you may be thinking Oh my goodness how do I start to get better sleep What are you tips for good sleep Well beyond avoiding the damaging and harmful impact of alcohol and caffeine on sleep and if youre struggling with sleep at night avoiding naps during the day I have two pieces of advice for you The first is regularity Go to bed at the same time wake up at the same time no matter whether its the weekday or the weekend Regularity is king and it will anchor your sleep and improve the quantity and the quality of that sleep The second is keep it cool Your body needs to drop its core temperature by about two to three degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep and then to stay asleep and its the reason you will always find it easier to fall asleep in a room thats too cold than too hot So aim for a bedroom temperature of around 65 degrees or about 18 degrees Celsius Thats going to be optimal for the sleep of most people And then finally in taking a step back then what is the missioncritical statement here Well I think it may be this sleep unfortunately is not an optional lifestyle luxury Sleep is a nonnegotiable biological necessity It is your lifesupport system and it is Mother Natures best effort yet at immortality And the decimation of sleep throughout industrialized nations is having a catastrophic impact on our health our wellness even the safety and the education of our children Its a silent sleep loss epidemic and its fast becoming one of the greatest public health challenges that we face in the 21st century I believe it is now time for us to reclaim our right to a full night of sleep and without embarrassment or that unfortunate stigma of laziness And in doing so we can be reunited with the most powerful elixir of life the Swiss Army knife of health as it were And with that soapbox rant over I will simply say good night good luck and above all  I do hope you sleep well Thank you very much indeed Thank you Thank you so much David Biello No no no Stay there for a second Good job not running away though I appreciate that So that was terrifying Matt Walker Youre welcome DB Yes thank you thank you Since we cant catch up on sleep what are we supposed to do What do we do when were like tossing and turning in bed late at night or doing shift work or whatever else MW So youre right we cant catch up on sleep Sleep is not like the bank You cant accumulate a debt and then hope to pay it off at a later point in time I should also note the reason that its so catastrophic and that our health deteriorates so quickly first its because human beings are the only species that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep for no apparent reason DB Because were smart MW And I make that point because it means that Mother Nature throughout the course of evolution has never had to face the challenge of this thing called sleep deprivation So shes never developed a safety net and thats why when you undersleep things just sort of implode so quickly both within the brain and the body So you just have to prioritize DB OK but tossing and turning in bed what do I do MW So if you are staying in bed awake for too long you should get out of bed and go to a different room and do something different The reason is because your brain will very quickly associate your bedroom with the place of wakefulness and you need to break that association So only return to bed when you are sleepy and that way you will relearn the association that you once had which is your bed is the place of sleep So the analogy would be youd never sit at the dinner table waiting to get hungry so why would you lie in bed waiting to get sleepy DB Well thank you for that wakeup call Great job Matt MW Youre very welcome Thank you very muchI am a writer Writing books is my profession but its more than that of course It is also my great lifelong love and fascination And I dont expect that thats ever going to change But that said something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book this memoir called Eat Pray Love which decidedly unlike any of my previous books went out in the world for some reason and became this big megasensation international bestseller thing The result of which is that everywhere I go now people treat me like Im doomed Seriously  doomed doomed Like they come up to me now all worried and they say Arent you afraid youre never going to be able to top that Arent you afraid youre going to keep writing for your whole life and youre never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all ever again So thats reassuring you know But it would be worse except for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago when I was a teenager when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writer I was met with this same sort of fearbased reaction And people would say Arent you afraid youre never going to have any success Arent you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you Arent you afraid that youre going to work your whole life at this craft and nothings ever going to come of it and youre going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure Like that you know The answer  the short answer to all those questions is Yes Yes Im afraid of all those things And I always have been And Im afraid of many many more things besides that people cant even guess at like seaweed and other things that are scary But when it comes to writing the thing that Ive been sort of thinking about lately and wondering about lately is why You know is it rational Is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do And what is it specifically about creative ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each others mental health in a way that other careers kind of dont do you know Like my dad for example was a chemical engineer and I dont recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer you know That chemicalengineering block John hows it going It just didnt come up like that you know But to be fair chemical engineers as a group havent really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manicdepressives We writers we kind of do have that reputation and not just writers but creative people across all genres it seems have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the 20th century alone of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands you know And even the ones who didnt literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts you know Norman Mailer just before he died last interview he said Every one of my books has killed me a little more An extraordinary statement to make about your lifes work But we dont even blink when we hear somebody say this because weve heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow weve completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry in the end will always ultimately lead to anguish And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea Are you comfortable with that Because you look at it even from an inch away and you know  Im not at all comfortable with that assumption I think its odious And I also think its dangerous and I dont want to see it perpetuated into the next century I think its better if we encourage our great creative minds to live And I definitely know that in my case  in my situation  it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption particularly given the circumstance that Im in right now in my career Which is  you know like check it out Im pretty young Im only about 40 years old I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me And its exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book right I should just put it bluntly because were all sort of friends here now  its exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me So Jesus what a thought Thats the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine oclock in the morning and I dont want to go there I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love And so the question becomes how And so it seems to me upon a lot of reflection that the way that I have to work now in order to continue writing is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct right I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me as I am writing and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be from now on And as Ive been looking over the last year for models for how to do that Ive been sort of looking across time and Ive been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome So stay with me because it does circle around and back But ancient Greece and ancient Rome  people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then OK People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source for distant and unknowable reasons The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity daemons Socrates famously believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar The Romans had the same idea but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius Which is great because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual They believed that a genius was this sort of magical divine entity who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artists studio kind of like Dobby the house elf and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work So brilliant  there it is right there that distance that Im talking about  that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work And everyone knew that this is how it functioned right So the ancient artist was protected from certain things like for example too much narcissism right If your work was brilliant you couldnt take all the credit for it everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you If your work bombed not entirely your fault you know Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time And then the Renaissance came and everything changed and we had this big idea and the big idea was lets put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries and theres no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine And its the beginning of rational humanism and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual And for the first time in history you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius And I got to tell you I think that was a huge error You know I think that allowing somebody one mere person to believe that he or she is like the vessel you know like the font and the essence and the source of all divine creative unknowable eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche Its like asking somebody to swallow the sun It just completely warps and distorts egos and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years And if this is true and I think it is true the question becomes what now Can we do this differently Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery Maybe not Maybe we cant just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18 minute speech And theres probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of basically fairies who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff Im not probably going to bring you all along with me on this But the question that I kind of want to pose is  you know why not Why not think about it this way Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process A process which as anybody who has ever tried to make something  which is to say basically everyone here  knows does not always behave rationally And in fact can sometimes feel downright paranormal I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone whos now in her 90s but shes been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia she would be out working in the fields and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape And she said it was like a thunderous train of air And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape And she felt it coming because it would shake the earth under her feet She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point and that was to in her words run like hell And she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her she could collect it and grab it on the page And other times she wouldnt be fast enough so shed be running and running and she wouldnt get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape looking as she put it for another poet And then there were these times  this is the piece I never forgot  she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it right So shes running to the house and shes looking for the paper and the poem passes through her and she grabs a pencil just as its going through her and then she said it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it She would catch the poem by its tail and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page And in these instances the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards from the last word to the first So when I heard that I was like  thats uncanny thats exactly what my creative process is like Thats not at all what my creative process is  Im not the pipeline Im a mule and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly But even I in my mulishness even I have brushed up against that thing at times And I would imagine that a lot of you have too You know even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify And what is that thing And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds but in fact might actually keep us sane And for me the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that is the musician Tom Waits who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment And we were talking about this and you know Tom for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses that were totally internalized But then he got older he got calmer and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles and this is when it all changed for him And hes speeding along and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of melody that comes into his head as inspiration often comes elusive and tantalizing and he wants it its gorgeous and he longs for it but he has no way to get it He doesnt have a piece of paper or a pencil or a tape recorder So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like Im going to lose this thing and Ill be be haunted by this song forever Im not good enough and I cant do it And instead of panicking he just stopped He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel He just looked up at the sky and he said Excuse me can you not see that Im driving Do I look like I can write down a song right now If you really want to exist come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you Otherwise go bother somebody else today Go bother Leonard Cohen And his whole work process changed after that Not the work the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever But the process and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble and released it back where it came from and realized that this didnt have to be this internalized tormented thing It could be this peculiar wondrous bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between Tom and the strange external thing that was not quite Tom When I heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too and this idea already saved me once It saved me when I was in the middle of writing Eat Pray Love and I fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when were working on something and its not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster the worst book ever written Not just bad but the worst book ever written And I started to think I should just dump this project But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room And I said aloud Listen you thing you and I both know that if this book isnt brilliant that is not entirely my fault right Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this I dont have any more than this If you want it to be better youve got to show up and do your part of the deal But if you dont do that you know what the hell with it Im going to keep writing anyway because thats my job And I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job Because  Because in the end its like this OK  centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours until dawn They were always magnificent because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific right But every once in a while very rarely something would happen and one of these performers would actually become transcendent And I know you know what Im talking about because I know youve all seen at some point in your life a performance like this It was like time would stop and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasnt doing anything different than he had ever done 1000 nights before but everything would align And all of a sudden he would no longer appear to be merely human He would be lit from within and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divinity And when this happened back then people knew it for what it was you know they called it by its name They would put their hands together and they would start to chant Allah Allah Allah God God God Thats God you know Curious historical footnote when the Moors invaded southern Spain they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from Allah Allah Allah to Olé olé olé which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances In Spain when a performer has done something impossible and magic Allah olé olé Allah magnificent bravo incomprehensible there it is  a glimpse of God Which is great because we need that But the tricky bit comes the next morning for the dancer himself when he wakes up and discovers that its Tuesday at 11 am and hes no longer a glimpse of God Hes just an aging mortal with really bad knees and maybe hes never going to ascend to that height again And maybe nobody will ever chant Gods name again as he spins and what is he then to do with the rest of his life This is hard This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life But maybe it doesnt have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe in the first place that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when youre finished with somebody else And you know if we think about it this way it starts to change everything This is how Ive started to think and this is certainly how Ive been thinking in the last few months as Ive been working on the book that will soon be published as the dangerously frighteningly overanticipated follow up to my freakish success And what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that is dont be afraid Dont be daunted Just do your job Continue to show up for your piece of it whatever that might be If your job is to dance do your dance If the divine cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed for just one moment through your efforts then Olé And if not do your dance anyhow And Olé to you nonetheless I believe this and I feel that we must teach it Olé to you nonetheless just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up Thank youWhen you have 21 minutes to speak two million years seems like a really long time But evolutionarily two million years is nothing And yet in two million years the human brain has nearly tripled in mass going from the oneandaquarterpound brain of our ancestor here Habilis to the almost threepound meatloaf everybody here has between their ears What is it about a big brain that nature was so eager for every one of us to have one Well it turns out when brains triple in size they dont just get three times bigger they gain new structures And one of the main reasons our brain got so big is because it got a new part called the frontal lobe particularly a part called the prefrontal cortex What does a prefrontal cortex do for you that should justify the entire architectural overhaul of the human skull in the blink of evolutionary time Well it turns out the prefrontal cortex does lots of things but one of the most important things it does is its an experience simulator Pilots practice in flight simulators so that they dont make real mistakes in planes Human beings have this marvelous adaptation that they can actually have experiences in their heads before they try them out in real life This is a trick that none of our ancestors could do and that no other animal can do quite like we can Its a marvelous adaptation Its up there with opposable thumbs and standing upright and language as one of the things that got our species out of the trees and into the shopping mall All of you have done this Ben and Jerrys doesnt have liver and onion ice cream and its not because they whipped some up tried it and went Yuck Its because without leaving your armchair you can simulate that flavor and say yuck before you make it Lets see how your experience simulators are working Lets just run a quick diagnostic before I proceed with the rest of the talk Heres two different futures that I invite you to contemplate You can try to simulate them and tell me which one you think you might prefer One of them is winning the lottery This is about 314 million dollars And the other is becoming paraplegic Just give it a moment of thought You probably dont feel like you need a moment of thought Interestingly there are data on these two groups of people data on how happy they are And this is exactly what you expected isnt it But these arent the data I made these up footnote footnote These are the data You failed the pop quiz and youre hardly five minutes into the lecture Because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs and a year after winning the lotto lottery winners and paraplegics are equally happy with their lives footnote footnote Dont feel too bad about failing the first pop quiz because everybody fails all of the pop quizzes all of the time The research that my laboratory has been doing that economists and psychologists around the country have been doing has revealed something really quite startling to us something we call the impact bias which is the tendency for the simulator to work badly for the simulator to make you believe that different outcomes are more different than in fact they really are From field studies to laboratory studies we see that winning or losing an election gaining or losing a romantic partner getting or not getting a promotion passing or not passing a college test on and on have far less impact less intensity and much less duration than people expect them to have A recent study  this almost floors me  a recent study showing how major life traumas affect people suggests that if it happened over three months ago with only a few exceptions it has no impact whatsoever on your happiness Why Because happiness can be synthesized Sir Thomas Brown wrote in 1642 I am the happiest man alive I have that in me that can convert poverty to riches adversity to prosperity I am more invulnerable than Achilles fortune hath not one place to hit me What kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head Well it turns out its precisely the same remarkable machinery that all of us have Human beings have something that we might think of as a psychological immune system a system of cognitive processes largely nonconscious cognitive processes that help them change their views of the world so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves Like Sir Thomas you have this machine Unlike Sir Thomas you seem not to know it We synthesize happiness but we think happiness is a thing to be found Now you dont need me to give you too many examples of people synthesizing happiness I suspect though Im going to show you some experimental evidence You dont have to look very far for evidence I took a copy of the New York Times and tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness Here are three guys synthesizing happiness Im better off physically financially mentally  I dont have one minutes regret It was a glorious experience I believe it turned out for the best Who are these characters who are so damn happy The first one is Jim Wright Some of you are old enough to remember he was the chairman of the House of Representatives and he resigned in disgrace when this young Republican named Newt Gingrich found out about a shady book deal that he had done He lost everything The most powerful Democrat in the country lost everything he lost his money he lost his power What does he have to say all these years later about it I am so much better off physically financially mentally and in almost every other way What other way would there be to be better off Vegetably Minerally Animally Hes pretty much covered them there footnote footnote Moreese Bickham is somebody youve never heard of Moreese Bickham uttered these words upon being released He was 78 years old Hed spent 37 years in Louisiana State Penitentiary for a crime he didnt commit He was ultimately released for good behavior halfway through his sentence What did he have to say about his experience I dont have one minutes regret It was a glorious experience Glorious This guys not saying There were some nice guys They had a gym Glorious  a word we usually reserve for something like a religious experience Harry S Langerman uttered these words Hes somebody you might have known but didnt because in 1949 he read a little article in the paper about a hamburger stand owned by these two brothers named McDonald And he thought Thats a really neat idea So he went to find them They said We can give you a franchise on this for 3000 bucks Harry went back to New York asked his brother an investment banker to loan him 3000 dollars and his brothers immortal words were You idiot nobody eats hamburgers He wouldnt lend him the money Of course six months later Ray Kroc had exactly the same idea It turns out people do eat hamburgers and Ray Kroc for a while became the richest man in America And then finally some of you recognize this young photo of Pete Best who was the original drummer for the Beatles until they you know sent him out on an errand and snuck away and picked up Ringo on a tour Well in 1994 when Pete Best was interviewed  yes hes still a drummer yes hes a studio musician  he had this to say Im happier than I would have been with the Beatles OK theres something important to be learned from these people and it is the secret of happiness Here it is finally to be revealed First accrue wealth power and prestige then lose it Second spend as much of your life in prison as you possibly can Third make somebody else really really rich And finally never ever join the Beatles Yeah right Because when people synthesize happiness as these gentlemen seem to have done we all smile at them but we kind of roll our eyes and say Yeah right you never really wanted the job Oh yeah right  you really didnt have that much in common with her and you figured that out just about the time she threw the engagement ring in your face We smirk because we believe that synthetic happiness is not of the same quality as what we might call natural happiness What are these terms Natural happiness is what we get when we get what we wanted and synthetic happiness is what we make when we dont get what we wanted And in our society we have a strong belief that synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind Why do we have that belief Well its very simple What kind of economic engine would keep churning if we believed that not getting what we want could make us just as happy as getting it With all apologies to my friend Matthieu Ricard a shopping mall full of Zen monks is not going to be particularly profitable because they dont want stuff enough I want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness is every bit as real and enduring as the kind of happiness you stumble upon when you get exactly what you were aiming for Now Im a scientist so Im going to do this not with rhetoric but by marinating you in a little bit of data footnote footnote Let me first show you an experimental paradigm thats used to demonstrate the synthesis of happiness among regular old folks This isnt mine its a 50yearold paradigm called the free choice paradigm Its very simple You bring in say six objects and you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least liked In this case because this experiment uses them these are Monet prints Everybody ranks these Monet prints from the one they like the most to the one they like the least Now we give you a choice We happen to have some extra prints in the closet Were going to give you one as your prize to take home We happen to have number three and number four we tell the subject This is a bit of a difficult choice because neither one is preferred strongly to the other but naturally people tend to pick number three because they liked it a little better than number four Sometime later  it could be 15 minutes it could be 15 days  the same stimuli are put before the subject and the subject is asked to rerank the stimuli Tell us how much you like them now What happens Watch as happiness is synthesized This is the result thats been replicated over and over again Youre watching happiness be synthesized Would you like to see it again Happiness The one I got is really better than I thought That other one I didnt get sucks Thats the synthesis of happiness Now whats the right response to that Yeah right Now heres the experiment we did and I hope this is going to convince you that Yeah right was not the right response We did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia These are hospitalized patients Most of them have Korsakoff syndrome a polyneuritic psychosis They drank way too much and they cant make new memories They remember their childhood but if you walk in and introduce yourself and then leave the room when you come back they dont know who you are We took our Monet prints to the hospital And we asked these patients to rank them from the one they liked the most to the one they liked the least We then gave them the choice between number three and number four Like everybody else they said Gee thanks Doc Thats great I could use a new print Ill take number three We explained we would have number three mailed to them We gathered up our materials and we went out of the room and counted to a half hour Back into the room we say Hi were back The patients bless them say Ah Doc Im sorry Ive got a memory problem thats why Im here If Ive met you before I dont remember Really Jim you dont remember I was just here with the Monet prints Sorry Doc I just dont have a clue No problem Jim All I want you to do is rank these for me from the one you like the most to the one you like the least What do they do Well lets first check and make sure theyre really amnesiac We ask these amnesiac patients to tell us which one they own which one they chose last time which one is theirs And what we find is amnesiac patients just guess These are normal controls where if I did this with you all of you would know which print you chose But if I do this with amnesiac patients they dont have a clue They cant pick their print out of a lineup Heres what normal controls do they synthesize happiness Right This is the change in liking score the change from the first time they ranked to the second time they ranked Normal controls show  that was the magic I showed you now Im showing it to you in graphical form  The one I own is better than I thought The one I didnt own the one I left behind is not as good as I thought Amnesiacs do exactly the same thing Think about this result These people like better the one they own but they dont know they own it Yeah right is not the right response What these people did when they synthesized happiness is they really truly changed their affective hedonic aesthetic reactions to that poster Theyre not just saying it because they own it because they dont know they own it When psychologists show you bars you know that they are showing you averages of lots of people And yet all of us have this psychological immune system this capacity to synthesize happiness but some of us do this trick better than others And some situations allow anybody to do it more effectively than other situations do It turns out that freedom the ability to make up your mind and change your mind is the friend of natural happiness because it allows you to choose among all those delicious futures and find the one that you would most enjoy But freedom to choose to change and make up your mind is the enemy of synthetic happiness and Im going to show you why Dilbert already knows of course Dogberts tech support How may I abuse you My printer prints a blank page after every document Why complain about getting free paper Free Arent you just giving me my own paper Look at the quality of the free paper compared to your lousy regular paper Only a fool or a liar would say that they look the same Now that you mention it it does seem a little silkier What are you doing Im helping people accept the things they cannot change Indeed The psychological immune system works best when we are totally stuck when we are trapped This is the difference between dating and marriage You go out on a date with a guy and he picks his nose you dont go out on another date Youre married to a guy and he picks his nose He has a heart of gold Dont touch the fruitcake You find a way to be happy with whats happened Now what I want to show you is that people dont know this about themselves and not knowing this can work to our supreme disadvantage footnote footnote Heres an experiment we did at Harvard We created a blackandwhite photography course and we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a darkroom So we gave them cameras they went around campus they took 12 pictures of their favorite professors and their dorm room and their dog and all the other things they wanted to have Harvard memories of They bring us the camera we make up a contact sheet they figure out which are the two best pictures We now spend six hours teaching them about darkrooms and they blow two of them up They have two gorgeous 8 x 10 glossies of meaningful things to them and we say Which one would you like to give up I have to give one up Yes we need one as evidence of the class project So you have to give me one You have to make a choice You get to keep one and I get to keep one Now there are two conditions in this experiment In one case the students are told But you know if you want to change your mind Ill always have the other one here and in the next four days before I actually mail it to headquarters  yeah headquarters  Ill be glad to swap it out with you In fact Ill come to your dorm room just give me an email Better yet Ill check with you You ever want to change your mind its totally returnable The other half of the students are told exactly the opposite Make your choice and by the way the mail is going out gosh in two minutes to England Your picture will be winging its way over the Atlantic You will never see it again Half of the students in each of these conditions are asked to make predictions about how much theyre going to come to like the picture that they keep and the picture they leave behind Other students are just sent back to their little dorm rooms and they are measured over the next three to six days on their satisfaction with the pictures Look at what we find First of all heres what students think is going to happen They think theyre going to maybe come to like the picture they chose a little more than the one they left behind But these are not statistically significant differences Its a very small increase and it doesnt much matter whether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition Wrongo Bad simulators Because heres whats really happening Both right before the swap and five days later people who are stuck with that picture who have no choice who can never change their mind like it a lot And people who are deliberating  Should I return it Have I gotten the right one Maybe this isnt the good one Maybe I left the good one  have killed themselves They dont like their picture In fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired they still dont like their picture Why Because the reversible condition is not conducive to the synthesis of happiness footnote footnote So heres the final piece of this experiment We bring in a whole new group of naive Harvard students and we say You know were doing a photography course and we can do it one of two ways We could do it so that when you take the two pictures youd have four days to change your mind or were doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it Which course would you like to be in Duh Sixtysix percent of the students twothirds prefer to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change their mind Hello Sixtysix percent of the students choose to be in the course in which they will ultimately be deeply dissatisfied with the picture  because they do not know the conditions under which synthetic happiness grows The Bard said everything best of course and hes making my point here but hes making it hyperbolically Tis nothing good or bad But thinking makes it so Its nice poetry but that cant exactly be right Is there really nothing good or bad Is it really the case that gall bladder surgery and a trip to Paris are just the same thing That seems like a onequestion IQ test They cant be exactly the same In more turgid prose but closer to the truth was the father of modern capitalism Adam Smith and he said this This is worth contemplating The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life seems to arise from overrating the difference between one permanent situation and another Some of these situations may no doubt deserve to be preferred to others but none of them can deserve to be pursued with that passionate ardor which drives us to violate the rules either of prudence or of justice or to corrupt the future tranquility of our minds either by shame from the remembrance of our own folly or by remorse for the horror of our own injustice In other words yes some things are better than others We should have preferences that lead us into one future over another But when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated the difference between these futures we are at risk When our ambition is bounded it leads us to work joyfully When our ambition is unbounded it leads us to lie to cheat to steal to hurt others to sacrifice things of real value When our fears are bounded were prudent were cautious were thoughtful When our fears are unbounded and overblown were reckless and were cowardly The lesson I want to leave you with from these data is that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown because we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity we are constantly chasing when we choose experience Thank youIm going to tell you a little bit about my TEDxHouston Talk I woke up the morning after I gave that talk with the worst vulnerability hangover of my life And I actually didnt leave my house for about three days The first time I left was to meet a friend for lunch And when I walked in she was already at the table I sat down and she said God you look like hell I said Thanks I feel really  Im not functioning And she said Whats going on And I said I just told 500 people that I became a researcher to avoid vulnerability And that when being vulnerable emerged from my data as absolutely essential to wholehearted living I told these 500 people that I had a breakdown I had a slide that said Breakdown At what point did I think that was a good idea And she said I saw your talk livestreamed It was not really you It was a little different than what you usually do But it was great And I said This cant happen YouTube theyre putting this thing on YouTube And were going to be talking about 600 700 people And she said Well I think its too late And I said Let me ask you something And she said Yeah I said Do you remember when we were in college really wild and kind of dumb She said Yeah I said Remember when wed leave a really bad message on our exboyfriends answering machine Then wed have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape And she goes Uh no Of course the only thing I could say at that point was Yeah me neither Yeah  me neither And Im thinking to myself Brené what are you doing Why did you bring this up Have you lost your mind Your sisters would be perfect for this So I looked back up and she said Are you really going to try to break in and steal the video before they put it on YouTube And I said Im just thinking about it a little bit She said Youre like the worst vulnerability role model ever Then I looked at her and I said something that at the time felt a little dramatic but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic If 500 turns into 1000 or 2000 my life is over I had no contingency plan for four million And my life did end when that happened And maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that I learned something hard about myself and that was that as much as I would be frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small staying right under the radar But I want to talk about what Ive learned Theres two things that Ive learned in the last year The first is vulnerability is not weakness And that myth is profoundly dangerous Let me ask you honestly  and Ill give you this warning Im trained as a therapist so I can outwait you uncomfortably  so if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome  how many of you honestly when youre thinking about doing or saying something vulnerable think God vulnerability is weakness How many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously The majority of people Now let me ask you this question This past week at TED how many of you when you saw vulnerability up here thought it was pure courage Vulnerability is not weakness I define vulnerability as emotional risk exposure uncertainty It fuels our daily lives And Ive come to the belief  this is my 12th year doing this research  that vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage  to be vulnerable to let ourselves be seen to be honest One of the weird things thats happened is after the TED explosion I got a lot of offers to speak all over the country  everyone from schools and parent meetings to Fortune 500 companies And so many of the calls went like this Dr Brown we loved your TED talk Wed like you to come in and speak Wed appreciate it if you wouldnt mention vulnerability or shame What would you like for me to talk about Theres three big answers This is mostly to be honest with you from the business sector innovation creativity and change So let me go on the record and say vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation creativity and change To create is to make something that has never existed before Theres nothing more vulnerable than that Adaptability to change is all about vulnerability The second thing in addition to really finally understanding the relationship between vulnerability and courage the second thing I learned is this We have to talk about shame And Im going to be really honest with you When I became a vulnerability researcher and that became the focus because of the TED talk  and Im not kidding Ill give you an example About three months ago I was in a sporting goods store buying goggles and shin guards and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store About from a hundred feet away this is what I hear Vulnerability TED Vulnerability TED Im a fifthgeneration Texan Our family motto is Lock and load I am not a natural vulnerability researcher So Im like just keep walking shes on my six And then I hear Vulnerability TED I turn around I go Hi Shes right here and she said Youre the shame researcher who had the breakdown At this point parents are like pulling their children close Look away And Im so worn out at this point in my life I look at her and I actually say It was a fricking spiritual awakening And she looks back and does this I know And she said We watched your TED talk in my book club Then we read your book and we renamed ourselves The Breakdown Babes And she said Our tagline is Were falling apart and it feels fantastic You can only imagine what its like for me in a faculty meeting So when I became Vulnerability TED like an action figure  Like Ninja Barbie but Im Vulnerability TED  I thought Im going to leave that shame stuff behind because I spent six years studying shame before I started writing and talking about vulnerability And I thought thank God because shame is this horrible topic no one wants to talk about it Its the best way to shut people down on an airplane What do you do I study shame Oh And I see you But in surviving this last year I was reminded of a cardinal rule  not a research rule but a moral imperative from my upbringing  youve got to dance with the one who brung ya And I did not learn about vulnerability and courage and creativity and innovation from studying vulnerability I learned about these things from studying shame And so I want to walk you in to shame Jungian analysts call shame the swampland of the soul And were going to walk in And the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there It is to put on some galoshes  and walk through and find our way around Heres why We heard the most compelling call ever to have a conversation in this country and I think globally around race right Yes We heard that Yes Cannot have that conversation without shame Because you cannot talk about race without talking about privilege And when people start talking about privilege they get paralyzed by shame We heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery which is have a checklist You cant fix that problem without addressing shame because when they teach those folks how to suture they also teach them how to stitch their selfworth to being allpowerful And allpowerful folks dont need checklists And I had to write down the name of this TED Fellow so I didnt mess it up here Myshkin Ingawale I hope I did right by you I saw the TED Fellows my first day here And he got up and he explained how he was driven to create some technology to help test for anemia because people were dying unnecessarily And he said I saw this need So you know what I did I made it And everybody just burst into applause and they were like Yes And he said And it didnt work And then I made it 32 more times and then it worked You know what the big secret about TED is I cant wait to tell people this I guess Im doing it right now This is like the failure conference No it is You know why this place is amazing Because very few people here are afraid to fail And no one who gets on the stage so far that Ive seen has not failed Ive failed miserably many times I dont think the world understands that because of shame Theres a great quote that saved me this past year by Theodore Roosevelt A lot of people refer to it as the Man in the Arena quote And it goes like this It is not the critic who counts It is not the man who sits and points out how the doer of deeds could have done things better and how he falls and stumbles The credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat But when hes in the arena at best he wins and at worst he loses but when he fails when he loses he does so daring greatly And thats what this conference to me is about Life is about daring greatly about being in the arena When you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door and you think Im going in and Im going to try this shame is the gremlin who says Uh uh Youre not good enough You never finished that MBA Your wife left you I know your dad really wasnt in Luxembourg he was in Sing Sing I know those things that happened to you growing up I know you dont think that youre pretty smart talented or powerful enough I know your dad never paid attention even when you made CFO Shame is that thing And if we can quiet it down and walk in and say Im going to do this we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing 99 percent of the time is who Us Shame drives two big tapes  never good enough  and if you can talk it out of that one who do you think you are The thing to understand about shame is its not guilt Shame is a focus on self guilt is a focus on behavior Shame is I am bad Guilt is I did something bad How many of you if you did something that was hurtful to me would be willing to say Im sorry I made a mistake How many of you would be willing to say that Guilt Im sorry I made a mistake Shame Im sorry I am a mistake Theres a huge difference between shame and guilt And heres what you need to know Shame is highly highly correlated with addiction depression violence aggression bullying suicide eating disorders And heres what you even need to know more Guilt inversely correlated with those things The ability to hold something weve done or failed to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive Its uncomfortable but its adaptive The other thing you need to know about shame is its absolutely organized by gender If shame washes over me and washes over Chris its going to feel the same Everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame Were pretty sure that the only people who dont experience shame are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy Which means yes I have a little shame no Im a sociopath So I would opt for yes you have a little shame Shame feels the same for men and women but its organized by gender For women the best example I can give you is Enjoli the commercial I can put the wash on the line pack the lunches hand out the kisses and be at work at five to nine I can bring home the bacon fry it up in the pan and never let you forget youre a man For women shame is do it all do it perfectly and never let them see you sweat I dont know how much perfume that commercial sold but I guarantee you it moved a lot of antidepressants and antianxiety meds Shame for women is this web of unobtainable conflicting competing expectations about who were supposed to be And its a straightjacket For men shame is not a bunch of competing conflicting expectations Shame is one do not be perceived as what Weak I did not interview men for the first four years of my study It wasnt until a man looked at me after a book signing and said I love what say about shame Im curious why you didnt mention men And I said I dont study men And he said Thats convenient And I said Why And he said Because you say to reach out tell our story be vulnerable But you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters I said Yeah Theyd rather me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall down When we reach out and be vulnerable we get the shit beat out of us And dont tell me its from the guys and the coaches and the dads Because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else So I started interviewing men and asking questions And what I learned is this You show me a woman who can actually sit with a man in real vulnerability and fear Ill show you a woman whos done incredible work You show me a man who can sit with a woman whos just had it she cant do it all anymore and his first response is not I unloaded the dishwasher But he really listens  because thats all we need  Ill show you a guy whos done a lot of work Shame is an epidemic in our culture And to get out from underneath it  to find our way back to each other we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way were parenting the way were working the way were looking at each other Very quickly some research by Mahalik at Boston College He asked what do women need to do to conform to female norms The top answers in this country nice thin modest and use all available resources for appearance When he asked about men what do men in this country need to do to conform with male norms the answers were always show emotional control work is first pursue status and violence If were going to find our way back to each other we have to understand and know empathy because empathys the antidote to shame If you put shame in a Petri dish it needs three things to grow exponentially secrecy silence and judgment If you put the same amount in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy it cant survive The two most powerful words when were in struggle me too And so Ill leave you with this thought If were going to find our way back to each other vulnerability is going to be that path And I know its seductive to stand outside the arena because I think I did it my whole life and think to myself Im going to go in there and kick some ass when Im bulletproof and when Im perfect And that is seductive But the truth is that never happens And even if you got as perfect as you could and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster when you got in there thats not what we want to see We want you to go in We want to be with you and across from you And we just want for ourselves and the people we care about and the people we work with to dare greatly So thank you all very much I really appreciate itLooking deeply inside nature through the magnifying glass of science designers extract principles processes and materials that are forming the very basis of design methodology From synthetic constructs that resemble biological materials to computational methods that emulate neural processes nature is driving design Design is also driving nature In realms of genetics regenerative medicine and synthetic biology designers are growing novel technologies not foreseen or anticipated by nature Bionics explores the interplay between biology and design As you can see my legs are bionic Today I will tell human stories of bionic integration how electromechanics attached to the body and implanted inside the body are beginning to bridge the gap between disability and ability between human limitation and human potential Bionics has defined my physicality In 1982 both of my legs were amputated due to tissue damage from frostbite incurred during a mountainclimbing accident At that time I didnt view my body as broken I reasoned that a human being can never be broken Technology is broken Technology is inadequate This simple but powerful idea was a call to arms to advance technology for the elimination of my own disability and ultimately the disability of others I began by developing specialized limbs that allowed me to return to the vertical world of rock and ice climbing I quickly realized that the artificial part of my body is malleable able to take on any form any function  a blank slate for which to create perhaps structures that could extend beyond biological capability I made my height adjustable I could be as short as five feet or as tall as Id like So when I was feeling bad about myself insecure I would jack my height up But when I was feeling confident and suave I would knock my height down a notch just to give the competition a chance Narrowedged feet allowed me to climb steep rock fissures where the human foot cannot penetrate and spiked feet enabled me to climb vertical ice walls without ever experiencing muscle leg fatigue Through technological innovation I returned to my sport stronger and better Technology had eliminated my disability and allowed me a new climbing prowess As a young man I imagined a future world where technology so advanced could rid the world of disability a world in which neural implants would allow the visually impaired to see A world in which the paralyzed could walk via body exoskeletons Sadly because of deficiencies in technology disability is rampant in the world This gentleman is missing three limbs As a testimony to current technology he is out of the wheelchair but we need to do a better job in bionics to allow one day full rehabilitation for a person with this level of injury At the MIT Media Lab weve established the Center for Extreme Bionics The mission of the center is to put forth fundamental science and technological capability that will allow the biomechatronic and regenerative repair of humans across a broad range of brain and body disabilities Today Im going to tell you how my legs function how they work as a case in point for this center Now I made sure to shave my legs last night because I knew Id be showing them off Bionics entails the engineering of extreme interfaces Theres three extreme interfaces in my bionic limbs mechanical how my limbs are attached to my biological body dynamic how they move like flesh and bone and electrical how they communicate with my nervous system Ill begin with mechanical interface In the area of design we still do not understand how to attach devices to the body mechanically Its extraordinary to me that in this day and age one of the most mature oldest technologies in the human timeline the shoe still gives us blisters How can this be We have no idea how to attach things to our bodies This is the beautifully lyrical design work of Professor Neri Oxman at the MIT Media Lab showing spatially varying exoskeletal impedances shown here by color variation in this 3Dprinted model Imagine a future where clothing is stiff and soft where you need it when you need it for optimal support and flexibility without ever causing discomfort My bionic limbs are attached to my biological body via synthetic skins with stiffness variations that mirror my underlying tissue biomechanics To achieve that mirroring we first developed a mathematical model of my biological limb To that end we used imaging tools such as MRI to look inside my body to figure out the geometries and locations of various tissues We also took robotic tools  heres a 14actuator circle that goes around the biological limb The actuators come in find the surface of the limb measure its unloaded shape and then they push on the tissues to measure tissue compliances at each anatomical point We combine these imaging and robotic data to build a mathematical description of my biological limb shown on the left You see a bunch of points or nodes At each node theres a color that represents tissue compliance We then do a mathematical transformation to the design of the synthetic skin shown on the right And weve discovered optimality is where the body is stiff the synthetic skin should be soft where the body is soft the synthetic skin is stiff and this mirroring occurs across all tissue compliances With this framework weve produced bionic limbs that are the most comfortable limbs Ive ever worn Clearly in the future our clothing our shoes our braces our prostheses will no longer be designed and manufactured using artisan strategies but rather datadriven quantitative frameworks In that future our shoes will no longer give us blisters Were also embedding sensing and smart materials into the synthetic skins This is a material developed by SRI International California Under electrostatic effect it changes stiffness So under zero voltage the material is compliant its floppy like paper Then the buttons pushed a voltage is applied and it becomes stiff as a board We embed this material into the synthetic skin that attaches my bionic limb to my biological body When I walk here its no voltage My interface is soft and compliant The buttons pushed voltage is applied and it stiffens offering me a greater maneuverability over the bionic limb Were also building exoskeletons This exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft in just the right areas of the running cycle to protect the biological joints from high impacts and degradation In the future well all be wearing exoskeletons in common activities such as running Next dynamic interface How do my bionic limbs move like flesh and bone At my MIT lab we study how humans with normal physiologies stand walk and run What are the muscles doing and how are they controlled by the spinal cord This basic science motivates what we build Were building bionic ankles knees and hips Were building body parts from the ground up The bionic limbs that Im wearing are called BiOMs Theyve been fitted to nearly 1000 patients 400 of which have been wounded US soldiers How does it work At heel strike under computer control the system controls stiffness to attenuate the shock of the limb hitting the ground Then at midstance the bionic limb outputs high torques and powers to lift the person into the walking stride comparable to how muscles work in the calf region This bionic propulsion is very important clinically to patients So on the left you see the bionic device worn by a lady on the right a passive device worn by the same lady that fails to emulate normal muscle function enabling her to do something everyone should be able to do go up and down their steps at home Bionics also allows for extraordinary athletic feats Heres a gentleman running up a rocky pathway This is Steve Martin  not the comedian  who lost his legs in a bomb blast in Afghanistan Were also building exoskeletal structures using these same principles that wrap around the biological limb This gentleman does not have any leg condition any disability He has a normal physiology so these exoskeletons are applying musclelike torques and powers so that his own muscles need not apply those torques and powers This is the first exoskeleton in history that actually augments human walking It significantly reduces metabolic cost Its so profound in its augmentation that when a normal healthy person wears the device for 40 minutes and then takes it off their own biological legs feel ridiculously heavy and awkward Were beginning the age in which machines attached to our bodies will make us stronger and faster and more efficient Moving on to electrical interface How do my bionic limbs communicate with my nervous system Across my residual limb are electrodes that measure the electrical pulse of my muscles Thats communicated to the bionic limb so when I think about moving my phantom limb the robot tracks those movement desires This diagram shows fundamentally how the bionic limb is controlled So we model the missing biological limb and weve discovered what reflexes occurred how the reflexes of the spinal cord are controlling the muscles And that capability is embedded in the chips of the bionic limb What weve done then is we modulate the sensitivity of the reflex the modeled spinal reflex with the neural signal so when I relax my muscles in my residual limb I get very little torque and power but the more I fire my muscles the more torque I get and I can even run And that was the first demonstration of a running gait under neural command Feels great We want to go a step further We want to actually close the loop between the human and the bionic external limb Were doing experiments where were growing nerves transected nerves through channels or microchannel arrays On the other side of the channel the nerve then attaches to cells skin cells and muscle cells In the motor channels we can sense how the person wishes to move That can be sent out wirelessly to the bionic limb then sensory information on the bionic limb can be converted to stimulations in adjacent channels sensory channels So when this is fully developed and for human use persons like myself will not only have synthetic limbs that move like flesh and bone but actually feel like flesh and bone This video shows Lisa Mallette shortly after being fitted with two bionic limbs Indeed bionics is making a profound difference in peoples lives Lisa Mallette Oh my God LM Oh my God I cant believe it LM Its just like Ive got a real leg Woman Now dont start running Man Now turn around and do the same thing walking up but get on your heel to toe like you would normally just walk on level ground Try to walk right up the hill LM Oh my God Man Is it pushing you up LM Yes Im not even  I cant even describe it Man Its pushing you right up Hugh Herr Next week Im visiting the Center  Thank you Thank you Thank you Next week Im visiting the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Im going to try to convince CMS to grant appropriate code language and pricing so this technology can be made available to the patients that need it Thank you Its not well appreciated but over half of the worlds population suffers from some form of cognitive emotional sensory or motor condition and because of poor technology too often conditions result in disability and a poorer quality of life Basic levels of physiological function should be a part of our human rights Every person should have the right to live life without disability if they so choose  the right to live life without severe depression the right to see a loved one in the case of seeingimpaired or the right to walk or to dance in the case of limb paralysis or limb amputation As a society we can achieve these human rights if we accept the proposition that humans are not disabled A person can never be broken Our built environment our technologies are broken and disabled We the people need not accept our limitations but can transcend disability through technological innovation Indeed through fundamental advances in bionics in this century we will set the technological foundation for an enhanced human experience and we will end disability Id like to finish up with one more story a beautiful story The story of Adrianne HasletDavis Adrianne lost her left leg in the Boston terrorist attack I met Adrianne when this photo was taken at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital Adrianne is a dancer a ballroom dancer Adrianne breathes and lives dance It is her expression It is her art form Naturally when she lost her limb in the Boston terrorist attack she wanted to return to the dance floor After meeting her and driving home in my car I thought Im an MIT professor I have resources Lets build her a bionic limb to enable her to go back to her life of dance I brought in MIT scientists with expertise in prosthetics robotics machine learning and biomechanics and over a 200day research period we studied dance We brought in dancers with biological limbs and we studied how they move what forces they apply on the dance floor and we took those data and we put forth fundamental principles of dance reflexive dance capability and we embedded that intelligence into the bionic limb Bionics is not only about making people stronger and faster Our expression our humanity can be embedded into electromechanics It was 35 seconds between the bomb blasts in the Boston terrorist attack In 35 seconds the criminals and cowards took Adrianne off the dance floor In 200 days we put her back We will not be intimidated brought down diminished conquered or stopped by acts of violence Ladies and gentlemen please allow me to introduce Adrianne HasletDavis her first performance since the attack Shes dancing with Christian Lightner Ladies and gentlemen members of the research team Elliott Rouse and Nathan VillagarayCarski Elliott and NathanIm going to talk to you about some stuff thats in this book of mine that I hope will resonate with other things youve already heard and Ill try to make some connections myself in case you miss them But I want to start with what I call the official dogma The official dogma of what The official dogma of all Western industrial societies And the official dogma runs like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom The reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good valuable worthwhile essential to being human and because if people have freedom then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare and no one has to decide on our behalf The way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice The more choice people have the more freedom they have and the more freedom they have the more welfare they have This I think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldnt occur to anyone to question it And its also deeply embedded in our lives Ill give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us This is my supermarket Not such a big one I want to say just a word about salad dressing A hundred seventyfive salad dressings in my supermarket if you dont count the 10 extravirgin olive oils and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings in the offchance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you So this is what the supermarket is like And then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system  speakers CD player tape player tuner amplifier  and in this one single consumer electronics store there are that many stereo systems We can construct six and a half million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store Youve got to admit thats a lot of choice In other domains  the world of communications There was a time when I was a boy when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted as long as it came from Ma Bell You rented your phone you didnt buy it One consequence of that by the way is that the phone never broke And those days are gone We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones especially in the world of cell phones These are cell phones of the future My favorite is the middle one  the MP3 player nose hair trimmer and crème brûlée torch And if  if by some chance you havent seen that in your store yet you can rest assured that one day soon you will And what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question And do you know what the answer to this question now is The answer is no It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesnt do too much So in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things the same explosion of choice is true Health care It is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do Instead you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you Well we could do A or we could do B A has these benefits and these risks B has these benefits and these risks What do you want to do And you say Doc what should I do And the doc says A has these benefits and risks and B has these benefits and risks What do you want to do And you say If you were me Doc what would you do And the doc says But Im not you And the result is  we call it patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decisionmaking from somebody who knows something  namely the doctor  to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions  namely the patient Theres enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense at all since we cant buy them Why do they market to us if we cant buy them The answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescriptions to be changed Something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice as this slide is meant to indicate We dont inherit an identity we get to invent it And we get to reinvent ourselves as often as we like And that means that every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person you want to be With respect to marriage and family there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could and then you started having kids as soon as you could The only real choice was who not when and not what you did after Nowadays everything is very much up for grabs I teach wonderfully intelligent students and I assign 20 percent less work than I used to And its not because theyre less smart and its not because theyre less diligent Its because they are preoccupied asking themselves Should I get married or not Should I get married now Should I get married later Should I have kids first or a career first All of these are consuming questions And theyre going to answer these questions whether or not it means not doing all the work I assign and not getting a good grade in my courses And indeed they should These are important questions to answer Work We are blessed as Carl was pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet  except the Randolph Hotel There is one corner by the way that Im not going to tell anybody about where the WiFi actually works Im not telling you about it because I want to use it So what this means this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work is that we have to make a decision again and again and again about whether we should or shouldnt be working We can go to watch our kid play soccer and we have our cell phone on one hip and our Blackberry on our other hip and our laptop presumably on our laps And even if theyre all shut off every minute that were watching our kid mutilate a soccer game we are also asking ourselves Should I answer this cell phone call Should I respond to this email Should I draft this letter And even if the answer to the question is no its certainly going to make the experience of your kids soccer game very different than it wouldve been So everywhere we look big things and small things material things and lifestyle things life is a matter of choice And the world we used to live in looked like this Well actually they are written in stone That is to say there were some choices but not everything was a matter of choice The world we now live in looks like this The Ten Commandments DoItYourself Kit And the question is Is this good news or bad news And the answer is yes We all know whats good about it so Im going to talk about whats bad about it All of this choice has two effects two negative effects on people One effect paradoxically is that it produces paralysis rather than liberation With so many options to choose from people find it very difficult to choose at all Ill give you one very dramatic example of this a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans A colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about 2000 different workplaces What she found is that for every 10 mutual funds the employer offered rate of participation went down two percent You offer 50 funds  10 percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five Why Because with 50 funds to choose from its so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that youll just put it off till tomorrow and then tomorrow and then tomorrow and tomorrow and of course tomorrow never comes Understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they dont have enough money put away it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer By not participating they are passing up as much as 5000 dollars a year from the employer who would happily match their contribution So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices And I think it makes the world look like this And lastly for all eternity French bleu cheese or ranch You really want to get the decision right if its for all eternity right You dont want to pick the wrong mutual fund or wrong salad dressing So thats one effect The second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from And there are several reasons for this One of them is with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from if you buy one and its not perfect  and what salad dressing is  its easy to imagine that you couldve made a different choice that wouldve been better And what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made even if it was a good decision The more options there are the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose Second what economists call opportunity costs Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to Well when there are lots of alternatives to consider its easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject that make you less satisfied with the alternative that youve chosen Heres an example I cant stop thinking about those other available parking spaces on W 85th Street If youre not a New Yorker I apologize Heres what youre supposed to be thinking Heres this couple on the Hamptons Very expensive real estate Gorgeous beach Beautiful day They have it all to themselves What could be better Damn it this guy is thinking Its August Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away I could be parking right in front of my building And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity day after day to have a great parking space Opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction that we get out of what we choose even when what we choose is terrific And the more options there are to consider the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs Heres another example Now this cartoon makes a lot of points It makes points about living in the moment as well and probably about doing things slowly But one point it makes is that whenever youre choosing one thing youre choosing not to do other things and those other things may have lots of attractive features and its going to make what youre doing less attractive Third escalation of expectations This hit me when I went to replace my jeans I wear jeans almost all the time There was a time when jeans came in one flavor and you bought them and they fit like crap They were incredibly uncomfortable and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times they started to feel OK I went to replace my jeans after years of wearing these old ones I said I want a pair of jeans Heres my size And the shopkeeper said Do you want slim fit easy fit relaxed fit You want button fly or zipper fly You want stonewashed or acidwashed Do you want them distressed Do you want boot cut tapered Blah blah blah on and on he went My jaw dropped And after I recovered I said I want the kind that used to be the only kind He had no idea what that was So I spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans and I walked out of the store  truth  with the bestfitting jeans I had ever had I did better All this choice made it possible for me to do better But  I felt worse Why I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself The reason is  The reason I felt worse is that with all of these options available my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up I had very low no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor When they came in 100 flavors damn it one of them shouldve been perfect And what I got was good but it wasnt perfect And so I compared what I got to what I expected and what I got was disappointing in comparison to what I expected Adding options to peoples lives cant help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be And what thats going to produce is less satisfaction with results even when theyre good results It all looks so great I cant wait to be disappointed Nobody in the world of marketing knows this Because if they did you wouldnt all know what this was about The truth is more like this Everything was better back when everything was worse The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise Nowadays the world we live in  we affluent industrialized citizens with perfection the expectation  the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be You will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations my expectations have gone through the roof The secret to happiness  this is what you all came for  the secret to happiness is low expectations Youll do I want to say  just a little autobiographical moment  that I actually am married to a wife and shes really quite wonderful I couldnt have done better I didnt settle But settling isnt always such a bad thing Finally one consequence of buying a badfitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied and you ask why whos responsible the answer is clear the world is responsible What could you do When there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available and you buy one that is disappointing and you ask why whos responsible it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you You could have done better With a hundred different kinds of jeans on display there is no excuse for failure And so when people make decisions and even though the results of the decisions are good they feel disappointed about them they blame themselves Clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation I believe a significant  not the only but a significant  contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves they think theyre at fault So the net result is that we do better in general objectively and we feel worse So let me remind you this is the official dogma the one that we all take to be true and its all false It is not true Theres no question that some choice is better than none But it doesnt follow from that that more choice is better than some choice Theres some magical amount I dont know what it is Im pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare Now as a policy matter  Im almost done  as a policy matter the thing to think about is this what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material affluence There are lots of places in the world and we have heard about several of them where their problem is not that they have too much choice Their problem is they have too little So the stuff Im talking about is the peculiar problem of modern affluent Western societies And what is so frustrating and infuriating is this Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficulttoinstall child seats dont help Its a waste of money What Im telling you is that these expensive complicated choices  its not simply that they dont help They actually hurt They actually make us worse off If some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options not only would those peoples lives be improved but ours would be improved also This is what economists call a Paretoimproving move Income redistribution will make everyone better off not just poor people because of how all this excess choice plagues us So to conclude You can be anything you want to be  no limits Youre supposed to read this cartoon and being a sophisticated person say Ah What does this fish know Nothing is possible in this fishbowl Impoverished imagination a myopic view of the world  thats the way I read it at first The more I thought about it however the more I came to the view that this fish knows something Because the truth of the matter is if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible you dont have freedom You have paralysis If you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible you decrease satisfaction You increase paralysis and you decrease satisfaction Everybody needs a fishbowl This one is almost certainly too limited  perhaps even for the fish certainly for us But the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery and I suspect disaster Thank you very muchWell we all need a reason to wake up For me it just took 11000 volts I know youre too polite to ask so I will tell you One night sophomore year of college just back from Thanksgiving holiday a few of my friends and I were horsing around and we decided to climb atop a parked commuter train It was just sitting there with the wires that run overhead Somehow that seemed like a great idea at the time Wed certainly done stupider things I scurried up the ladder on the back and when I stood up the electrical current entered my arm blew down and out my feet and that was that Would you believe that watch still works Takes a licking My father wears it now in solidarity That night began my formal relationship with death  my death  and it also began my long run as a patient Its a good word It means one who suffers So I guess were all patients Now the American health care system has more than its fair share of dysfunction  to match its brilliance to be sure Im a physician now a hospice and palliative medicine doc so Ive seen care from both sides And believe me almost everyone who goes into healthcare really means well  I mean truly But we who work in it are also unwitting agents for a system that too often does not serve Why Well theres actually a pretty easy answer to that question and it explains a lot because healthcare was designed with diseases not people at its center Which is to say of course it was badly designed And nowhere are the effects of bad design more heartbreaking or the opportunity for good design more compelling than at the end of life where things are so distilled and concentrated There are no doovers My purpose today is to reach out across disciplines and invite design thinking into this big conversation That is to bring intention and creativity to the experience of dying We have a monumental opportunity in front of us before one of the few universal issues as individuals as well as a civil society to rethink and redesign how it is we die So lets begin at the end For most people the scariest thing about death isnt being dead its dying suffering Its a key distinction To get underneath this it can be very helpful to tease out suffering which is necessary as it is from suffering we can change The former is a natural essential part of life part of the deal and to this we are called to make space adjust grow It can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves They bring proportionality like a cosmic rightsizing After my limbs were gone that loss for example became fact fixed  necessarily part of my life and I learned that I could no more reject this fact than reject myself It took me a while but I learned it eventually Now another great thing about necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that unites caregiver and care receiver  human beings This we are finally realizing is where healing happens Yes compassion  literally as we learned yesterday  suffering together Now on the systems side on the other hand so much of the suffering is unnecessary invented It serves no good purpose But the good news is since this brand of suffering is made up well we can change it How we die is indeed something we can affect Making the system sensitive to this fundamental distinction between necessary and unnecessary suffering gives us our first of three design cues for the day After all our role as caregivers as people who care is to relieve suffering  not add to the pile True to the tenets of palliative care I function as something of a reflective advocate as much as prescribing physician Quick aside palliative care  a very important field but poorly understood  while it includes it is not limited to end of life care It is not limited to hospice Its simply about comfort and living well at any stage So please know that you dont have to be dying anytime soon to benefit from palliative care Now let me introduce you to Frank Sort of makes this point Ive been seeing Frank now for years Hes living with advancing prostate cancer on top of longstanding HIV We work on his bone pain and his fatigue but most of the time we spend thinking out loud together about his life  really about our lives In this way Frank grieves In this way he keeps up with his losses as they roll in so that hes ready to take in the next moment Loss is one thing but regret quite another Frank has always been an adventurer  he looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting  and no fan of regret So it wasnt surprising when he came into clinic one day saying he wanted to raft down the Colorado River Was this a good idea With all the risks to his safety and his health some would say no Many did but he went for it while he still could It was a glorious marvelous trip freezing water blistering dry heat scorpions snakes wildlife howling off the flaming walls of the Grand Canyon  all the glorious side of the world beyond our control Franks decision while maybe dramatic is exactly the kind so many of us would make if we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves over time So much of what were talking about today is a shift in perspective After my accident when I went back to college I changed my major to art history Studying visual art I figured Id learn something about how to see  a really potent lesson for a kid who couldnt change so much of what he was seeing Perspective that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with turning anguish into a flower Flash forward now I work at an amazing place in San Francisco called the Zen Hospice Project where we have a little ritual that helps with this shift in perspective When one of our residents dies the mortuary men come and as were wheeling the body out through the garden heading for the gate we pause Anyone who wants  fellow residents family nurses volunteers the hearse drivers too now  shares a story or a song or silence as we sprinkle the body with flower petals It takes a few minutes its a sweet simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth rather than repugnance Contrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting much like this  floodlit room lined with tubes and beeping machines and blinking lights that dont stop even when the patients life has Cleaning crew swoops in the bodys whisked away and it all feels as though that person had never really existed Wellintended of course in the name of sterility but hospitals tend to assault our senses and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness  anesthetic literally the opposite of aesthetic I revere hospitals for what they can do I am alive because of them But we ask too much of our hospitals They are places for acute trauma and treatable illness They are no place to live and die thats not what they were designed for Now mind you  I am not giving up on the notion that our institutions can become more humane Beauty can be found anywhere I spent a few months in a burn unit at St Barnabas Hospital in Livingston New Jersey where I got really great care at every turn including good palliative care for my pain And one night it began to snow outside I remember my nurses complaining about driving through it And there was no window in my room but it was great to just imagine it coming down all sticky Next day one of my nurses smuggled in a snowball for me She brought it in to the unit I cannot tell you the rapture I felt holding that in my hand and the coldness dripping onto my burning skin the miracle of it all the fascination as I watched it melt and turn into water In that moment just being any part of this planet in this universe mattered more to me than whether I lived or died That little snowball packed all the inspiration I needed to both try to live and be OK if I did not In a hospital thats a stolen moment In my work over the years Ive known many people who were ready to go ready to die Not because they had found some final peace or transcendence but because they were so repulsed by what their lives had become  in a word cut off or ugly There are already record numbers of us living with chronic and terminal illness and into ever older age And we are nowhere near ready or prepared for this silver tsunami We need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handle these seismic shifts in our population Now is the time to create something new something vital I know we can because we have to The alternative is just unacceptable And the key ingredients are known policy education and training systems bricks and mortar We have tons of input for designers of all stripes to work with We know for example from research whats most important to people who are closer to death comfort feeling unburdened and unburdening to those they love existential peace and a sense of wonderment and spirituality Over Zen Hospices nearly 30 years weve learned much more from our residents in subtle detail Little things arent so little Take Janette She finds it harder to breathe one day to the next due to ALS Well guess what She wants to start smoking again  and French cigarettes if you please Not out of some selfdestructive bent but to feel her lungs filled while she has them Priorities change Or Kate  she just wants to know her dog Austin is lying at the foot of her bed his cold muzzle against her dry skin instead of more chemotherapy coursing through her veins  shes done that Sensuous aesthetic gratification where in a moment in an instant we are rewarded for just being So much of it comes down to loving our time by way of the senses by way of the body  the very thing doing the living and the dying Probably the most poignant room in the Zen Hospice guest house is our kitchen which is a little strange when you realize that so many of our residents can eat very little if anything at all But we realize we are providing sustenance on several levels smell a symbolic plane Seriously with all the heavyduty stuff happening under our roof one of the most tried and true interventions we know of is to bake cookies As long as we have our senses  even just one  we have at least the possibility of accessing what makes us feel human connected Imagine the ripples of this notion for the millions of people living and dying with dementia Primal sensorial delights that say the things we dont have words for impulses that make us stay present  no need for a past or a future So if teasing unnecessary suffering out of the system was our first design cue then tending to dignity by way of the senses by way of the body  the aesthetic realm  is design cue number two Now this gets us quickly to the third and final bit for today namely we need to lift our sights to set our sights on wellbeing so that life and health and healthcare can become about making life more wonderful rather than just less horrible Beneficence Here this gets right at the distinction between a diseasecentered and a patient or humancentered model of care and here is where caring becomes a creative generative even playful act Play may sound like a funny word here But it is also one of our highest forms of adaptation Consider every major compulsory effort it takes to be human The need for food has birthed cuisine The need for shelter has given rise to architecture The need for cover fashion And for being subjected to the clock well we invented music So since dying is a necessary part of life what might we create with this fact By play I am in no way suggesting we take a light approach to dying or that we mandate any particular way of dying There are mountains of sorrow that cannot move and one way or another we will all kneel there Rather I am asking that we make space  physical psychic room to allow life to play itself all the way out  so that rather than just getting out of the way aging and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end We cant solve for death I know some of you are working on this Meanwhile we can  We can design towards it Parts of me died early on and thats something we can all say one way or another I got to redesign my life around this fact and I tell you it has been a liberation to realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meaning in what life you have left like that snowball lasting for a perfect moment all the while melting away If we love such moments ferociously then maybe we can learn to live well  not in spite of death but because of it Let death be what takes us not lack of imagination Thank youFor a really long time I had two mysteries that were hanging over me I didnt understand them and to be honest I was quite afraid to look into them The first mystery was Im 40 years old and all throughout my lifetime year after year serious depression and anxiety have risen in the United States in Britain and across the Western world And I wanted to understand why Why is this happening to us Why is it that with each year that passes more and more of us are finding it harder to get through the day And I wanted to understand this because of a more personal mystery When I was a teenager I remember going to my doctor and explaining that I had this feeling like pain was leaking out of me I couldnt control it I didnt understand why it was happening I felt quite ashamed of it And my doctor told me a story that I now realize was wellintentioned but quite oversimplified Not totally wrong My doctor said We know why people get like this Some people just naturally get a chemical imbalance in their heads  youre clearly one of them All we need to do is give you some drugs it will get your chemical balance back to normal footnote footnote So I started taking a drug called Paxil or Seroxat its the same thing with different names in different countries And I felt much better I got a real boost But not very long afterwards this feeling of pain started to come back So I was given higher and higher doses until for 13 years I was taking the maximum possible dose that youre legally allowed to take And for a lot of those 13 years and pretty much all the time by the end I was still in a lot of pain And I started asking myself Whats going on here Because youre doing everything youre told to do by the story thats dominating the culture  why do you still feel like this So to get to the bottom of these two mysteries for a book that Ive written I ended up going on a big journey all over the world I traveled over 40000 miles I wanted to sit with the leading experts in the world about what causes depression and anxiety and crucially what solves them and people who have come through depression and anxiety and out the other side in all sorts of ways And I learned a huge amount from the amazing people I got to know along the way footnote footnote But I think at the heart of what I learned is so far we have scientific evidence for nine different causes of depression and anxiety Two of them are indeed in our biology Your genes can make you more sensitive to these problems though they dont write your destiny And there are real brain changes that can happen when you become depressed that can make it harder to get out But most of the factors that have been proven to cause depression and anxiety are not in our biology They are factors in the way we live And once you understand them it opens up a very different set of solutions that should be offered to people alongside the option of chemical antidepressants For example if youre lonely youre more likely to become depressed If when you go to work you dont have any control over your job youve just got to do what youre told youre more likely to become depressed If you very rarely get out into the natural world youre more likely to become depressed And one thing unites a lot of the causes of depression and anxiety that I learned about Not all of them but a lot of them Everyone here knows youve all got natural physical needs right Obviously You need food you need water you need shelter you need clean air If I took those things away from you youd all be in real trouble real fast But at the same time every human being has natural psychological needs You need to feel you belong You need to feel your life has meaning and purpose You need to feel that people see you and value you You need to feel youve got a future that makes sense And this culture we built is good at lots of things And many things are better than in the past  Im glad to be alive today But weve been getting less and less good at meeting these deep underlying psychological needs And its not the only thing thats going on but I think its the key reason why this crisis keeps rising and rising And I found this really hard to absorb I really wrestled with the idea of shifting from thinking of my depression as just a problem in my brain to one with many causes including many in the way were living footnote footnote And it only really began to fall into place for me when one day I went to interview a South African psychiatrist named Dr Derek Summerfield Hes a great guy And Dr Summerfield happened to be in Cambodia in 2001 when they first introduced chemical antidepressants for people in that country And the local doctors the Cambodians had never heard of these drugs so they were like what are they And he explained And they said to him We dont need them weve already got antidepressants And he was like What do you mean He thought they were going to talk about some kind of herbal remedy like St Johns Wort ginkgo biloba something like that Instead they told him a story There was a farmer in their community who worked in the rice fields And one day he stood on a land mine left over from the war with the United States and he got his leg blown off So they him an artificial leg and after a while he went back to work in the rice fields But apparently its super painful to work under water when youve got an artificial limb and Im guessing it was pretty traumatic to go back and work in the field where he got blown up The guy started to cry all day he refused to get out of bed he developed all the symptoms of classic depression The Cambodian doctor said This is when we gave him an antidepressant And Dr Summerfield said What was it They explained that they went and sat with him They listened to him They realized that his pain made sense  it was hard for him to see it in the throes of his depression but actually it had perfectly understandable causes in his life One of the doctors talking to the people in the community figured You know if we bought this guy a cow he could become a dairy farmer he wouldnt be in this position that was screwing him up so much he wouldnt have to go and work in the rice fields So they bought him a cow Within a couple of weeks his crying stopped within a month his depression was gone They said to doctor Summerfield So you see doctor that cow that was an antidepressant thats what you mean right footnote footnote If youd been raised to think about depression the way I was and most of the people here were that sounds like a bad joke right I went to my doctor for an antidepressant she gave me a cow But what those Cambodian doctors knew intuitively based on this individual unscientific anecdote is what the leading medical body in the world the World Health Organization has been trying to tell us for years based on the best scientific evidence If youre depressed if youre anxious youre not weak youre not crazy youre not in the main a machine with broken parts Youre a human being with unmet needs And its just as important to think here about what those Cambodian doctors and the World Health Organization are not saying They did not say to this farmer Hey buddy you need to pull yourself together Its your job to figure out and fix this problem on your own On the contrary what they said is Were here as a group to pull together with you so together we can figure out and fix this problem This is what every depressed person needs and its what every depressed person deserves footnote footnote This is why one of the leading doctors at the United Nations in their official statement for World Health Day couple of years back in 2017 said we need to talk less about chemical imbalances and more about the imbalances in the way we live Drugs give real relief to some people  they gave relief to me for a while  but precisely because this problem goes deeper than their biology the solutions need to go much deeper too But when I first learned that I remember thinking OK I could see all the scientific evidence I read a huge number of studies I interviewed a huge number of the experts who were explaining this but I kept thinking How can we possibly do that The things that are making us depressed are in most cases more complex than what was going on with this Cambodian farmer Where do we even begin with that insight But then in the long journey for my book all over the world I kept meeting people who were doing exactly that from Sydney to San Francisco to São Paulo I kept meeting people who were understanding the deeper causes of depression and anxiety and as groups fixing them Obviously I cant tell you about all the amazing people I got to know and wrote about or all of the nine causes of depression and anxiety that I learned about because they wont let me give a 10hour TED Talk  you can complain about that to them footnote footnote But I want to focus on two of the causes and two of the solutions that emerge from them if thats alright Heres the first We are the loneliest society in human history There was a recent study that asked Americans Do you feel like youre no longer close to anyone And 39 percent of people said that described them No longer close to anyone In the international measurements of loneliness Britain and the rest of Europe are just behind the US in case anyone here is feeling smug footnote footnote I spent a lot of time discussing this with the leading expert in the world on loneliness an incredible man named professor John Cacioppo who was at Chicago and I thought a lot about one question his work poses to us Professor Cacioppo asked Why do we exist Why are we here why are we alive One key reason is that our ancestors on the savannas of Africa were really good at one thing They werent bigger than the animals they took down a lot of the time they werent faster than the animals they took down a lot of the time but they were much better at banding together into groups and cooperating This was our superpower as a species  we band together just like bees evolved to live in a hive humans evolved to live in a tribe And we are the first humans ever to disband our tribes And it is making us feel awful But it doesnt have to be this way One of the heroes in my book and in fact in my life is a doctor named Sam Everington Hes a general practitioner in a poor part of East London where I lived for many years And Sam was really uncomfortable because he had loads of patients coming to him with terrible depression and anxiety And like me hes not opposed to chemical antidepressants he thinks they give some relief to some people But he could see two things Firstly his patients were depressed and anxious a lot of the time for totally understandable reasons like loneliness And secondly although the drugs were giving some relief to some people for many people they didnt solve the problem The underlying problem One day Sam decided to pioneer a different approach A woman came to his center his medical center called Lisa Cunningham I got to know Lisa later And Lisa had been shut away in her home with crippling depression and anxiety for seven years And when she came to Sams center she was told Dont worry well carry on giving you these drugs but were also going to prescribe something else Were going to prescribe for you to come here to this center twice a week to meet with a group of other depressed and anxious people not to talk about how miserable you are but to figure out something meaningful you can all do together so you wont be lonely and you wont feel like life is pointless The first time this group met Lisa literally started vomiting with anxiety it was so overwhelming for her But people rubbed her back the group started talking they were like What could we do These are innercity East London people like me they didnt know anything about gardening They were like Why dont we learn gardening There was an area behind the doctors offices that was just scrubland Why dont we make this into a garden They started to take books out of the library started to watch YouTube clips They started to get their fingers in the soil They started to learn the rhythms of the seasons Theres a lot of evidence that exposure to the natural world is a really powerful antidepressant But they started to do something even more important They started to form a tribe They started to form a group They started to care about each other If one of them didnt show up the others would go looking for them  Are you OK Help them figure out what was troubling them that day The way Lisa put it to me As the garden began to bloom we began to bloom footnote footnote This approach is called social prescribing its spreading all over Europe And theres a small but growing body of evidence suggesting it can produce real and meaningful falls in depression and anxiety And one day I remember standing in the garden that Lisa and her oncedepressed friends had built  its a really beautiful garden  and having this thought its very much inspired by a guy called professor Hugh Mackay in Australia I was thinking so often when people feel down in this culture what we say to them  Im sure everyone here said it I have  we say You just need to be you be yourself And Ive realized actually what we should say to people is Dont be you Dont be yourself Be us be we Be part of a group The solution to these problems does not lie in drawing more and more on your resources as an isolated individual  thats partly what got us in this crisis It lies on reconnecting with something bigger than you And that really connects to one of the other causes of depression and anxiety that I wanted to talk to you about So everyone knows junk food has taken over our diets and made us physically sick I dont say that with any sense of superiority I literally came to give this talk from McDonalds I saw all of you eating that healthy TED breakfast I was like no way But just like junk food has taken over our diets and made us physically sick a kind of junk values have taken over our minds and made us mentally sick For thousands of years philosophers have said if you think life is about money and status and showing off youre going to feel like crap Thats not an exact quote from Schopenhauer but that is the gist of what he said footnote footnote But weirdly hardy anyone had scientifically investigated this until a truly extraordinary person I got to know named professor Tim Kasser whos at Knox College in Illinois and hes been researching this for about 30 years now And his research suggests several really important things Firstly the more you believe you can buy and display your way out of sadness and into a good life the more likely you are to become depressed and anxious And secondly as a society we have become much more driven by these beliefs All throughout my lifetime under the weight of advertising and Instagram and everything like them And as I thought about this I realized its like weve all been fed since birth a kind of KFC for the soul Weve been trained to look for happiness in all the wrong places and just like junk food doesnt meet your nutritional needs and actually makes you feel terrible junk values dont meet your psychological needs and they take you away from a good life But when I first spent time with professor Kasser and I was learning all this I felt a really weird mixture of emotions Because on the one hand I found this really challenging I could see how often in my own life when I felt down I tried to remedy it with some kind of showoffy grand external solution And I could see why that did not work well for me I also thought isnt this kind of obvious Isnt this almost like banal right If I said to everyone here none of you are going to lie on your deathbed and think about all the shoes you bought and all the retweets you got youre going to think about moments of love meaning and connection in your life I think that seems almost like a cliché But I kept talking to professor Kasser and saying Why am I feeling this strange doubleness And he said At some level we all know these things But in this culture we dont live by them We know them so well theyve become clichés but we dont live by them I kept asking why why would we know something so profound but not live by it And after a while professor Kasser said to me Because we live in a machine that is designed to get us to neglect what is important about life I had to really think about that Because we live in a machine that is designed to get us to neglect what is important about life footnote footnote And professor Kasser wanted to figure out if we can disrupt that machine Hes done loads of research into this Ill tell you about one example and I really urge everyone here to try this with their friends and family With a guy called Nathan Dungan he got a group of teenagers and adults to come together for a series of sessions over a period of time to meet up And part of the point of the group was to get people to think about a moment in their life they had actually found meaning and purpose For different people it was different things For some people it was playing music writing helping someone  Im sure everyone here can picture something right And part of the point of the group was to get people to ask OK how could you dedicate more of your life to pursuing these moments of meaning and purpose and less to I dont know buying crap you dont need putting it on social media and trying to get people to go OMG so jealous footnote footnote And what they found was just having these meetings it was like a kind of Alcoholics Anonymous for consumerism right Getting people to have these meetings articulate these values determine to act on them and check in with each other led to a marked shift in peoples values It took them away from this hurricane of depressiongenerating messages training us to seek happiness in the wrong places and towards more meaningful and nourishing values that lift us out of depression But with all the solutions that I saw and have written about and many I cant talk about here I kept thinking you know Why did it take me so long to see these insights Because when you explain them to people  some of them are more complicated but not all  when you explain this to people its not like rocket science right At some level we already know these things Why do we find it so hard to understand I think theres many reasons But I think one reason is that we have to change our understanding of what depression and anxiety actually are There are very real biological contributions to depression and anxiety But if we allow the biology to become the whole picture as I did for so long as I would argue our culture has done pretty much most of my life what were implicitly saying to people is and this isnt anyones intention but what were implicitly saying to people is Your pain doesnt mean anything Its just a malfunction Its like a glitch in a computer program its just a wiring problem in your head But I was only able to start changing my life when I realized your depression is not a malfunction Its a signal Your depression is a signal Its telling you something We feel this way for reasons and they can be hard to see in the throes of depression  I understand that really well from personal experience But with the right help we can understand these problems and we can fix these problems together But to do that the very first step is we have to stop insulting these signals by saying theyre a sign of weakness or madness or purely biological except for a tiny number of people We need to start listening to these signals because theyre telling us something we really need to hear Its only when we truly listen to these signals and we honor these signals and respect these signals that were going to begin to see the liberating nourishing deeper solutions The cows that are waiting all around us Thank youIm a professional troublemaker As my job is to critique the world the shoddy systems and the people who refuse to do better as a writer as a speaker as a shady Nigerian  I feel like my purpose is to be this cat I am the person who is looking at other people like I need you to fix it That is me I want us to leave this world better than we found it And how I choose to effect change is by speaking up by being the first and by being the domino For a line of dominoes to fall one has to fall first which then leaves the other choiceless to do the same And that domino that falls were hoping that OK the next person that sees this is inspired to be a domino Being the domino for me looks like speaking up and doing the things that are really difficult especially when they are needed with the hope that others will follow suit And heres the thing Im the person who says what you might be thinking but dared not to say A lot of times people think that were fearless the people who do this were fearless Were not fearless Were not unafraid of the consequences or the sacrifices that we have to make by speaking truth to power What happens is we feel like we have to because there are too few people in the world willing to be the domino too few people willing to take that fall Were not doing it without fear Now lets talk about fear I knew exactly what I wanted to be when I grew up I was like Im going to be a doctor Doctor Luvvie was the dream I was Doc McStuffins before it was a thing And I remember when I went to college my freshman year I had to take Chemistry 101 for my premed major I got the first and last D of my academic career So I went to my advisor and I was like OK lets drop the premed because this doctor thing is not going to work because I dont even like hospitals So  Lets just consider that done for And that same semester I started blogging That was 2003 So as that one dream was ending another was beginning And then what was a cute hobby became my fulltime job when I lost my marketing job in 2010 But it still took me two more years to say Im a writer Nine years after I had started writing before I said Im a writer because I was afraid of what happens without 401ks without How am I going to keep up my shoe habit Thats important to me So it took me that long to own this thing that was what my purpose was And then I realized fear has a very concrete power of keeping us from doing and saying the things that are our purpose And I was like You know what Im not going to let fear rule my life Im not going to let fear dictate what I do And then all of these awesome things started happening and dominoes started to fall So when I realized that I was like OK 2015 I turned 30 its going to be my year of Do it anyway Anything that scares me Im going to actively pursue it So Im a Capricorn I like my feel solidly on the ground I decided to take my firstever solo vacation and it was out of the country to the Dominican Republic So on my birthday what did I do I went ziplining through the forests of Punta Cana And for some odd reason I had on business casual Dont ask why And I had an incredible time Also I dont like being submerged in water I like to be again on solid ground So I went to Mexico and swam with dolphins underwater And then the cool thing that I did also that year that was my mountain was I wrote my book Im Judging You The DoBetter Manual And I had to own  that whole writing thing now right Yes But the very antime thing that I did that year that scared the crap out of me  I went skydiving Were about to fall out of the plane I was like Ive done some stupid things in life This is one of them And then we come falling down to Earth and I literally lose my breath as I see Earth and I was like I just fell out of a perfectly good plane on purpose What is wrong with me But then I looked down at the beauty and I was like This is the best thing I could have done This was an amazing decision And I think about the times when I have to speak truth It feels like I am falling out of that plane It feels like that moment when Im at the edge of the plane and Im like You shouldnt do this but then I do it anyway because I realize I have to Sitting at the edge of that plane and kind of staying on that plane is comfort to me And I feel like every day that Im speaking truth against institutions and people who are bigger than me and just forces that are more powerful than me I feel like Im falling out of that plane But I realize comfort is overrated Because being quiet is comfortable Keeping things the way theyve been is comfortable And all comfort has done is maintain the status quo So weve got to get comfortable with being uncomfortable by speaking these hard truths when theyre necessary And I  And for me though I realize that I have to speak these truths because honesty is so important to me My integrity is something I hold dear Justice  I dont think justice should be an option We should always have justice Also I believe in shea butter as a core value and  and I think the world would be better if we were more moisturized But besides that with these as my core values I have to speak the truth I have no other choice in the matter But people like me the professional troublemakers should not be the only ones who are committed to being these dominoes who are always falling out of planes or being the first one to take this hit People are so afraid of these acute consequences not realizing that there are many times when we walk in rooms and we are some of the most powerful people in those rooms  we might be the secondmost powerful thirdmost powerful And I firmly believe that our job in those times is to disrupt what is happening And then if were not the most powerful if two more of us band together it makes us powerful Its like cosigning the woman in the meeting you know the woman who cant seem to get her word out or just making sure that other person who cant make a point is being heard Our job is to make sure they have room for that Everyones wellbeing is community business If we made that a point wed understand that for the times when we need help we wouldnt have to look around so hard if we made sure we were somebody elses help And there are times when I feel like I have taken very public tumbles and falls like the time when I was asked to speak at a conference and they wanted me to pay my way there And then I did some research and found out the white men who spoke there got compensated and got their travel paid for The white women who spoke there got their travel paid for The black women who spoke there were expected to actually pay to speak there And I was like What do I do And I knew that if I spoke up about this publicly I could face financial loss But then I also understood that my silence serves no one So I fearfully spoke up about it publicly and other women started coming out to talk about I too have faced this type of pay inequality And it started a conversation about discriminatory pay practices that this conference was participating in I felt like I was the domino the time I read a disturbing memoir by a public figure and wrote a piece about it I knew this person was more powerful than me and could impact my career but I was like Ive got to do this Ive got to sit at the edge of this plane maybe for two hours And I did And I pressed Publish and I ran away And I came back to a viral post and people being like Oh my God Im so glad somebody finally said this And it started a conversation about mental health and selfcare and I was like OK Alright This thing that Im doing I guess alright its doing something And then so many people have been the domino when they talk about how theyve been assaulted by powerful men And its made millions of women join in and say Me Too So a shoutout to Tarana Burke for igniting that movement People and systems count on our silence to keep us exactly where we are Now being the domino sometimes comes down to being exactly who you are So Ive been a shady somebody since I was three This is me on my third birthday But Ive been this girl all my life and I feel like even thats been the domino because in a world that wants us to walk around as representatives of ourselves being yourself can be a revolutionary act And in a world that wants us to whisper I choose to yell When its time to say these hard things I ask myself three things One Did you mean it Two Can you defend it Three Did you say it with love If the answer is yes to all three I say it and let the chips fall Thats important That checkpoint with myself always tells me Yes youre supposed to do this Telling the truth  telling thoughtful truths  should not be a revolutionary act Speaking truths to power should not be sacrificial but they are But I think if more of us chose to do this for the greater good wed be in better spaces than we are right now Speaking of the greater good I think we commit ourselves to telling truths to build bridges to common ground and bridges that arent based on truth will collapse So it is our job it is our obligation it is our duty to speak truth to power to be the domino not just when its difficult  especially when its difficult Thank youSo why do we learn mathematics Essentially for three reasons calculation application and last and unfortunately least in terms of the time we give it inspiration Mathematics is the science of patterns and we study it to learn how to think logically critically and creatively but too much of the mathematics that we learn in school is not effectively motivated and when our students ask Why are we learning this then they often hear that theyll need it in an upcoming math class or on a future test But wouldnt it be great if every once in a while we did mathematics simply because it was fun or beautiful or because it excited the mind Now I know many people have not had the opportunity to see how this can happen so let me give you a quick example with my favorite collection of numbers the Fibonacci numbers Yeah I already have Fibonacci fans here Thats great Now these numbers can be appreciated in many different ways From the standpoint of calculation theyre as easy to understand as one plus one which is two Then one plus two is three two plus three is five three plus five is eight and so on Indeed the person we call Fibonacci was actually named Leonardo of Pisa and these numbers appear in his book Liber Abaci which taught the Western world the methods of arithmetic that we use today In terms of applications Fibonacci numbers appear in nature surprisingly often The number of petals on a flower is typically a Fibonacci number or the number of spirals on a sunflower or a pineapple tends to be a Fibonacci number as well In fact there are many more applications of Fibonacci numbers but what I find most inspirational about them are the beautiful number patterns they display Let me show you one of my favorites Suppose you like to square numbers and frankly who doesnt Lets look at the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers So one squared is one two squared is four three squared is nine five squared is 25 and so on Now its no surprise that when you add consecutive Fibonacci numbers you get the next Fibonacci number Right Thats how theyre created But you wouldnt expect anything special to happen when you add the squares together But check this out One plus one gives us two and one plus four gives us five And four plus nine is 13 nine plus 25 is 34 and yes the pattern continues In fact heres another one Suppose you wanted to look at adding the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers Lets see what we get there So one plus one plus four is six Add nine to that we get 15 Add 25 we get 40 Add 64 we get 104 Now look at those numbers Those are not Fibonacci numbers but if you look at them closely youll see the Fibonacci numbers buried inside of them Do you see it Ill show it to you Six is two times three 15 is three times five 40 is five times eight two three five eight who do we appreciate Fibonacci Of course Now as much fun as it is to discover these patterns its even more satisfying to understand why they are true Lets look at that last equation Why should the squares of one one two three five and eight add up to eight times 13 Ill show you by drawing a simple picture Well start with a onebyone square and next to that put another onebyone square Together they form a onebytwo rectangle Beneath that Ill put a twobytwo square and next to that a threebythree square beneath that a fivebyfive square and then an eightbyeight square creating one giant rectangle right Now let me ask you a simple question what is the area of the rectangle Well on the one hand its the sum of the areas of the squares inside it right Just as we created it Its one squared plus one squared plus two squared plus three squared plus five squared plus eight squared Right Thats the area On the other hand because its a rectangle the area is equal to its height times its base and the height is clearly eight and the base is five plus eight which is the next Fibonacci number 13 Right So the area is also eight times 13 Since weve correctly calculated the area two different ways they have to be the same number and thats why the squares of one one two three five and eight add up to eight times 13 Now if we continue this process well generate rectangles of the form 13 by 21 21 by 34 and so on Now check this out If you divide 13 by eight you get 1625 And if you divide the larger number by the smaller number then these ratios get closer and closer to about 1618 known to many people as the Golden Ratio a number which has fascinated mathematicians scientists and artists for centuries Now I show all this to you because like so much of mathematics theres a beautiful side to it that I fear does not get enough attention in our schools We spend lots of time learning about calculation but lets not forget about application including perhaps the most important application of all learning how to think If I could summarize this in one sentence it would be this Mathematics is not just solving for x its also figuring out why Thank you very muchI was offered a position as associate professor of medicine and chief of scientific visualization at Yale University in the department of medicine And my job was to write many of the algorithms and code for NASA to do virtual surgery in preparation for the astronauts going into deepspace flight so they could be kept in robotic pods One of the fascinating things about what we were working on is that we were seeing using new scanning technologies things that had never been seen before Not only in disease management but also things that allowed us to see things about the body that just made you marvel I remember one of the first times we were looking at collagen And your entire body everything  your hair skin bone nails  everything is made of collagen And its a kind of ropelike structure that twirls and swirls like this And the only place that collagen changes its structure is in the cornea of your eye In your eye it becomes a grid formation and therefore it becomes transparent as opposed to opaque So perfectly organized a structure it was hard not to attribute divinity to it Because we kept on seeing this in different parts of the body One of the opportunities I had was one person was working on a really interesting micromagnetic resonance imaging machine with the NIH And what we were going to do was scan a new project on the development of the fetus from conception to birth using these new technologies So I wrote the algorithms and code and he built the hardware  Paul Lauterbur  then went onto win the Nobel Prize for inventing the MRI I got the data And Im going to show you a sample of the piece From Conception to Birth From Conception to Birth Oocyte Sperm Egg Inseminated 24 Hours Babys first division The fertilized ovum divides a few hours after fusion And divides anew every 12 to 15 hours Early Embryo Yolk sack still feeding baby 25 Days Heart chamber developing 32 Days Arms amp hands are developing 36 Days Beginning of the primitive vertebrae These weeks are the period of the most rapid development of the fetus If the fetus continues to grow at this speed for the entire 9 months it would be 15 tons at birth 45 Days Embryos heart is beating twice as fast as the mothers 51 Days Developing retina nose and fingers The fetus continual movement in the womb is necessary for muscular and skeletal growth 12 Weeks Indifferent penis Girl or boy yet to be determined 8 Months Delivery The expulsion stage The moment of birth Alexander Tsiaras Thank you But as you can see when you actually start working on this data its pretty spectacular And as we kept on scanning more and more working on this project looking at these two simple cells that have this unbelievable machinery that will become the magic of you And as we kept on working on this data looking at small clusters of the body these little pieces of tissue that were the trophoblasts coming off of the blastocyst all of a sudden burrowing itself into the side of the uterus saying Im here to stay Having conversation and communications with the estrogens the progesterones saying Im here to stay plant me building this incredible trilinear fetus that becomes within 44 days something that you can recognize and then at nine weeks is really kind of a little human being The marvel of this information How do we actually have this biological mechanism inside our body to actually see this information Im going to show you something pretty unique Heres a human heart at 25 days Its just basically two strands And like this magnificent origami cells are developing at one million cells per second at four weeks as its just folding on itself Within five weeks you start to see the early atrium and the early ventricles Six weeks these folds are now beginning with the papilla on the inside of the heart actually being able to pull down each one of those valves in your heart until you get a mature heart  and then basically the development of the entire human body The magic of the mechanisms inside each genetic structure saying exactly where that nerve cell should go  the complexity of these the mathematical models of how these things are indeed done are beyond human comprehension Even though I am a mathematician I look at this with marvel of how do these instruction sets not make these mistakes as they build what is us Its a mystery its magic its divinity Then you start to take a look at adult life Take a look at this little tuft of capillaries Its just a tiny subsubstructure microscopic But basically by the time youre nine months and youre given birth you have almost 60000 miles of vessels inside your body And only one mile is visible 59999 miles that are basically bringing nutrients and taking waste away The complexity of building that within a single system is again beyond any comprehension or any existing mathematics today And then instructions set from the brain to every other part of the body  look at the complexity of the folding Where does this intelligence of knowing that a fold can actually hold more information so as you actually watch the babys brain grow And this is one of the things were doing Were launching two new studies of scanning babies brains from the moment theyre born Every six months until theyre six years old were going to be doing about 250 children watching exactly how the gyri and the sulci of the brains fold to see how this magnificent development actually turns into memories and the marvel that is us And its not just our own existence but how does the womans body understand to have genetic structure that not only builds her own but then has the understanding that allows her to become a walking immunological cardiovascular system that basically is a mobile system that can actually nurture treat this child with a kind of marvel that is beyond again our comprehension  the magic that is existence that is us Thank youWere at a critical moment Our leaders some of our great institutions are failing us Why In some cases its because theyre bad or unethical but often theyve taken us to the wrong objectives And this is unacceptable This has to stop How are we going to correct these wrongs How are we going to choose the right course Its not going to be easy For years Ive worked with talented teams and theyve chosen the right objectives and the wrong objectives Many have succeeded others of them have failed And today Im going to share with you what really makes a difference  thats whats crucial how and why they set meaningful and audacious goals the right goals for the right reasons Lets go back to 1975 Yep this is me Ive got a lot to learn Im a computer engineer Ive got long hair but Im working under Andy Grove whos been called the greatest manager of his or any other era Andy was a superb leader and also a teacher and he said to me John it almost doesnt matter what you know Execution is what matters the most And so Andy invented a system called Objectives and Key Results It kind of rolls off the tongue doesnt it And its all about excellent execution So heres a classic video from the 1970s of professor Andy Grove Andy Grove The two key phrases of the management by objective systems are the objectives and the key results and they match the two purposes The objective is the direction The key results have to be measured but at the end you can look and without any argument say Did I do that or did I not do that Yes No Simple John Doerr Thats Andy Yes No Simple Objectives and Key Results or OKRs are a simple goalsetting system and they work for organizations they work for teams they even work for individuals The objectives are what you want to have accomplished The key results are how Im going to get that done Objectives Key results What and how But heres the truth many of us are setting goals wrong and most of us are not setting goals at all A lot of organizations set objectives and meet them They ship their sales they introduce their new products they make their numbers but they lack a sense of purpose to inspire their teams So how do you set these goals the right way First you must answer the question Why Why Because truly transformational teams combine their ambitions to their passion and to their purpose and they develop a clear and compelling sense of why I want to tell you a story I work with a remarkable entrepreneur Her name is Jini Kim She runs a company called Nuna Nuna is a health care data company And when Nuna was founded they used data to serve the health needs of lots of workers at large companies And then two years into the companys life the federal government issued a proposal to build the first ever cloud database for Medicaid Now youll remember that Medicaid is that program that serves 70 million Americans our poor our children and people with disabilities Nuna at the time was just 15 people and this database had to be built in one year and they had a whole set of commitments that they had to honor and frankly they werent going to make very much money on the project This was a betyourcompany moment and Jini seized it She jumped at the opportunity She did not flinch Why Well its a personal why Jinis younger brother Kimong has autism And when he was seven he had his first grand mal seizure at Disneyland He fell to the ground He stopped breathing Jinis parents are Korean immigrants They came to the country with limited resources speaking little English so it was up to Jini to enroll her family in Medicaid She was nine years old That moment defined her mission and that mission became her company and that company bid on won and delivered on that contract Heres Jini to tell you why Jini Kim Medicaid saved my family from bankruptcy and today it provides for Kimongs health and for millions of others Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid Every row of data is a life whose story deserves to be told with dignity JD And Jinis story tells us that a compelling sense of why can be the launchpad for our objectives Remember thats what we want to have accomplished And objectives are significant theyre actionoriented they are inspiring and theyre a kind of vaccine against fuzzy thinking You think a rockstar would be an unlikely user of Objectives and Key Results but for years Bono has used OKRs to wage a global war against poverty and disease and his ONE organization has focused on two really gorgeous audacious objectives The first is debt relief for the poorest countries in the world The next is universal access to antiHIV drugs Now why are these good objectives Lets go back to our checklist Significant Check Concrete Yes Actionoriented Yes Inspirational Well lets just listen to Bono Bono So youre passionate How passionate What actions does your passion lead you to do If the heart doesnt find a perfect rhyme with the head then your passion means nothing The OKR framework cultivates the madness the chemistry contained inside it It gives us an environment for risk for trust where failing is not a fireable offense And when you have that sort of structure and environment and the right people magic is around the corner JD I love that OKRs cultivate the madness and magic is right around the corner This is perfect So with Jini weve covered the whys with Bono the whats of goalsetting Lets turn our attention to the hows Remember the hows are the key results Thats how we meet our objectives And good results are specific and timebound Theyre aggressive but realistic Theyre measurable and theyre verifiable Those are good key results In 1999 I introduced OKRs to Googles cofounders Larry and Sergey Here they are 24 years old in their garage And Sergey enthusiastically said hed adopt them Well not quite What he really said was We dont have any other way to manage this company so well give it a go And I took that as a kind of endorsement But every quarter since then every Googler has written down her objectives and her key results Theyve graded them and theyve published them for everyone to see And these are not used for bonuses or for promotions Theyre set aside Theyre used for a higher purpose and thats to get collective commitment to truly stretch goals In 2008 a Googler Sundar Pichai took on an objective which was to build the next generation client platform for the future of web applications  in other words build the best browser He was very thoughtful about how he chose his key results How do you measure the best browser It could be ad clicks or engagement No He said numbers of users because users are going to decide if Chrome is a great browser or not So he had this one threeyearlong objective build the best browser And then every year he stuck to the same key results numbers of users but he upped the ante In the first year his goal was 20 million users and he missed it He got less than 10 Second year he raised the bar to 50 million He got to 37 million users Somewhat better In the third year he upped the ante once more to a hundred million He launched an aggressive marketing campaign broader distribution improved the technology and kaboom He got 111 million users Heres why I like this story not so much for the happy ending but it shows someone carefully choosing the right objective and then sticking to it year after year after year Its a perfect story for a nerd like me Now I think of OKRs as transparent vessels that are made from the whats and hows of our ambitions What really matters is the why that we pour into those vessels Thats why we do our work OKRs are not a silver bullet Theyre not going to be a substitute for a strong culture or for stronger leadership but when those fundamentals are in place they can take you to the mountaintop I want you to think about your life for a moment Do you have the right metrics Take time to write down your values your objectives and your key results Do it today If youd like some feedback on them you can send them to me Im johnwhatmatterscom If we think of the worldchanging goals of an Intel of a Nuna of Bono of Google theyre remarkable ubiquitous computing affordable health care highquality for everyone ending global poverty access to all the worlds information Heres the deal every one of those goals is powered today by OKRs Now Ive been called the Johnny Appleseed of OKRs for spreading the good gospel according to Andy Grove but I want you to join me in this movement Lets fight for what it is that really matters because we can take OKRs beyond our businesses We can take them to our families to our schools even to our governments We can hold those governments accountable We can transform those informations We can get back on the right track if we can and do measure what really matters Thank youSome people think that theres a TED Talk formula Give a talk on a round red rug Share a childhood story Divulge a personal secret End with an inspiring call to action No Thats not how to think of a TED Talk In fact if you overuse those devices youre just going to come across as clichéd or emotionally manipulative But there is one thing that all great TED Talks have in common and I would like to share that thing with you because over the past 12 years Ive had a ringside seat listening to many hundreds of amazing TED speakers like these Ive helped them prepare their talks for prime time and learned directly from them their secrets of what makes for a great talk And even though these speakers and their topics all seem completely different they actually do have one key common ingredient And its this Your number one task as a speaker is to transfer into your listeners minds an extraordinary gift  a strange and beautiful object that we call an idea Let me show you what I mean Heres Haley She is about to give a TED Talk and frankly shes terrified Presenter Haley Van Dyck Over the course of 18 minutes 1200 people many of whom have never seen each other before are finding that their brains are starting to sync with Haleys brain and with each other Theyre literally beginning to exhibit the same brainwave patterns And I dont just mean theyre feeling the same emotions Theres something even more startling happening Lets take a look inside Haleys brain for a moment There are billions of interconnected neurons in an impossible tangle But look here right here  a few million of them are linked to each other in a way which represents a single idea And incredibly this exact pattern is being recreated in real time inside the minds of everyone listening Thats right in just a few minutes a pattern involving millions of neurons is being teleported into 1200 minds just by people listening to a voice and watching a face But wait  what is an idea anyway Well you can think of it as a pattern of information that helps you understand and navigate the world Ideas come in all shapes and sizes from the complex and analytical to the simple and aesthetic Here are just a few examples shared from the TED stage Sir Ken Robinson  creativity is key to our kids future Sir Ken Robinson My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy and we should treat it with the same status Chris Anderson Elora Hardy  building from bamboo is beautiful Elora Hardy It is growing all around us its strong its elegant its earthquakeresistant CA Chimamanda Adichie  people are more than a single identity Chimamanda Adichie The single story creates stereotypes and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue but that they are incomplete CA Your mind is teeming with ideas and not just randomly Theyre carefully linked together Collectively they form an amazingly complex structure that is your personal worldview Its your brains operating system Its how you navigate the world And it is built up out of millions of individual ideas So for example if one little component of your worldview is the idea that kittens are adorable then when you see this youll react like this But if another component of your worldview is the idea that leopards are dangerous then when you see this youll react a little bit differently So its pretty obvious why the ideas that make up your worldview are crucial You need them to be as reliable as possible  a guide to the scary but wonderful real world out there Now different peoples worldviews can be dramatically different For example how does your worldview react when you see this image footnote footnote Dalia Mogahed What do you think when you look at me A woman of faith an expert maybe even a sister Or oppressed brainwashed a terrorist CA Whatever your answer there are millions of people out there who would react very differently So thats why ideas really matter If communicated properly theyre capable of changing forever how someone thinks about the world and shaping their actions both now and well into the future Ideas are the most powerful force shaping human culture So if you accept that your number one task as a speaker is to build an idea inside the minds of your audience here are four guidelines for how you should go about that task One limit your talk to just one major idea Ideas are complex things you need to slash back your content so that you can focus on the single idea youre most passionate about and give yourself a chance to explain that one thing properly You have to give context share examples make it vivid So pick one idea and make it the throughline running through your entire talk so that everything you say links back to it in some way Two give your listeners a reason to care Before you can start building things inside the minds of your audience you have to get their permission to welcome you in And the main tool to achieve that Curiosity Stir your audiences curiosity Use intriguing provocative questions to identify why something doesnt make sense and needs explaining If you can reveal a disconnection in someones worldview theyll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap And once youve sparked that desire it will be so much easier to start building your idea Three build your idea piece by piece out of concepts that your audience already understands You use the power of language to weave together concepts that already exist in your listeners minds  but not your language their language You start where they are The speakers often forget that many of the terms and concepts they live with are completely unfamiliar to their audiences Now metaphors can play a crucial role in showing how the pieces fit together because they reveal the desired shape of the pattern based on an idea that the listener already understands For example when Jennifer Kahn wanted to explain the incredible new biotechnology called CRISPR she said Its as if for the first time you had a word processor to edit DNA CRISPR allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily Now a vivid explanation like that delivers a satisfying aha moment as it snaps into place in our minds Its important therefore to test your talk on trusted friends and find out which parts they get confused by Four heres the final tip Make your idea worth sharing By that I mean ask yourself the question Who does this idea benefit And I need you to be honest with the answer If the idea only serves you or your organization then Im sorry to say its probably not worth sharing The audience will see right through you But if you believe that the idea has the potential to brighten up someone elses day or change someone elses perspective for the better or inspire someone to do something differently then you have the core ingredient to a truly great talk one that can be a gift to them and to all of usSeveral years ago here at TED Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge And the ideas pretty simple Teams of four have to build the tallest freestanding structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti one yard of tape one yard of string and a marshmallow The marshmallow has to be on top And though it seems really simple its actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly And so I thought this was an interesting idea and I incorporated it into a design workshop And it was a huge success And since then Ive conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects even the CTOs of the Fortune 50 and theres something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration and Id like to share some of them with you So normally most people begin by orienting themselves to the task They talk about it they figure out what its going to look like they jockey for power Then they spend some time planning organizing they sketch and they lay out spaghetti They spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into evergrowing structures And then finally just as theyre running out of time someone takes out the marshmallow and then they gingerly put it on top and then they stand back and  tada  they admire their work But what really happens most of the time is that the tada turns into an uhoh because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse So there are a number of people who have a lot more uhoh moments than others and among the worst are recent graduates of business school They lie they cheat they get distracted and they produce really lame structures And of course there are teams that have a lot more tada structures and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten And its pretty amazing As Peter tells us not only do they produce the tallest structures but theyre the most interesting structures of them all So the question you want to ask is How come Why What is it about them And Peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be CEO of Spaghetti Inc Right They dont spend time jockeying for power But theres another reason as well And the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan right And then they execute on it And then what happens is when they put the marshmallow on the top they run out of time and what happens Its a crisis Sound familiar Right What kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow and they build prototypes successive prototypes always keeping the marshmallow on top so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way Designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process And with each version kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesnt work So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential but lets look at how different teams perform So the average for most people is around 20 inches business schools students about half of that lawyers a little better but not much better than that kindergarteners better than most adults Who does the very best Architects and engineers thankfully Thirtynine inches is the tallest structure Ive seen And why is it Because they understand triangles and selfreinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures So CEOs a little bit better than average but heres where it gets interesting If you put you put an executive admin on the team they get significantly better Its incredible You know you look around you go Oh that teams going to win You can just tell beforehand And why is that Because they have special skills of facilitation They manage the process they understand the process And any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the teams performance Specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success If you have 10 teams that typically perform youll get maybe six or so that have standing structures And I tried something interesting I thought lets up the ante once So I offered a 10000 dollar prize of software to the winning team So what do you think happened to these design students What was the result Heres what happened Not one team had a standing structure If anyone had built say a one inch structure they would have taken home the prize So isnt that interesting That high stakes have a strong impact We did the exercise again with the same students What do you think happened then So now they understand the value of prototyping So the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time So theres deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success So you might ask Why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge And the reason is I help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects And what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions Because frankly every project has its own marshmallow doesnt it The challenge provides a shared experience a common language a common stance to build the right prototype And so this is the value of the experience of this so simple exercise And those of you who are interested may want to go to MarshmallowChallengecom Its a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows Theres stepbystep instructions on this There are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system Theres world records that are on this as well And the fundamental lesson I believe is that design truly is a contact sport It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task and that we apply the very best of our thinking our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand And sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an uhoh moment to a tada moment And that can make a big difference Thank you very muchSo Id like you to imagine for a moment that youre a soldier in the heat of battle Maybe youre a Roman foot soldier or a medieval archer or maybe youre a Zulu warrior Regardless of your time and place there are some things that are constant Your adrenaline is elevated and your actions are stemming from these deeply ingrained reflexes reflexes rooted in a need to protect yourself and your side and to defeat the enemy So now Id like you to imagine playing a very different role that of the scout The scouts job is not to attack or defend The scouts job is to understand The scout is the one going out mapping the terrain identifying potential obstacles And the scout may hope to learn that say theres a bridge in a convenient location across a river But above all the scout wants to know whats really there as accurately as possible And in a real actual army both the soldier and the scout are essential But you can also think of each of these roles as a mindset  a metaphor for how all of us process information and ideas in our daily lives What Im going to argue today is that having good judgment making accurate predictions making good decisions is mostly about which mindset youre in To illustrate these mindsets in action Im going to take you back to 19thcentury France where this innocuouslooking piece of paper launched one of the biggest political scandals in history It was discovered in 1894 by officers in the French general staff It was torn up in a wastepaper basket but when they pieced it back together they discovered that someone in their ranks had been selling military secrets to Germany So they launched a big investigation and their suspicions quickly converged on this man Alfred Dreyfus He had a sterling record no past history of wrongdoing no motive as far as they could tell But Dreyfus was the only Jewish officer at that rank in the army and unfortunately at this time the French Army was highly antiSemitic They compared Dreyfuss handwriting to that on the memo and concluded that it was a match even though outside professional handwriting experts were much less confident in the similarity but never mind that They went and searched Dreyfuss apartment looking for any signs of espionage They went through his files and they didnt find anything This just convinced them more that Dreyfus was not only guilty but sneaky as well because clearly he had hidden all of the evidence before they had managed to get to it Next they went and looked through his personal history for any incriminating details They talked to his teachers they found that he had studied foreign languages in school which clearly showed a desire to conspire with foreign governments later in life His teachers also said that Dreyfus was known for having a good memory which was highly suspicious right You know because a spy has to remember a lot of things So the case went to trial and Dreyfus was found guilty Afterwards they took him out into this public square and ritualistically tore his insignia from his uniform and broke his sword in two This was called the Degradation of Dreyfus And they sentenced him to life imprisonment on the aptly named Devils Island which is this barren rock off the coast of South America So there he went and there he spent his days alone writing letters and letters to the French government begging them to reopen his case so they could discover his innocence But for the most part France considered the matter closed One thing thats really interesting to me about the Dreyfus Affair is this question of why the officers were so convinced that Dreyfus was guilty I mean you might even assume that they were setting him up that they were intentionally framing him But historians dont think thats what happened As far as we can tell the officers genuinely believed that the case against Dreyfus was strong Which makes you wonder What does it say about the human mind that we can find such paltry evidence to be compelling enough to convict a man Well this is a case of what scientists call motivated reasoning Its this phenomenon in which our unconscious motivations our desires and fears shape the way we interpret information Some information some ideas feel like our allies We want them to win We want to defend them And other information or ideas are the enemy and we want to shoot them down So this is why I call motivated reasoning soldier mindset Probably most of you have never persecuted a FrenchJewish officer for high treason I assume but maybe youve followed sports or politics so you might have noticed that when the referee judges that your team committed a foul for example youre highly motivated to find reasons why hes wrong But if he judges that the other team committed a foul  awesome Thats a good call lets not examine it too closely Or maybe youve read an article or a study that examined some controversial policy like capital punishment And as researchers have demonstrated if you support capital punishment and the study shows that its not effective then youre highly motivated to find all the reasons why the study was poorly designed But if it shows that capital punishment works its a good study And vice versa if you dont support capital punishment same thing Our judgment is strongly influenced unconsciously by which side we want to win And this is ubiquitous This shapes how we think about our health our relationships how we decide how to vote what we consider fair or ethical Whats most scary to me about motivated reasoning or soldier mindset is how unconscious it is We can think were being objective and fairminded and still wind up ruining the life of an innocent man However fortunately for Dreyfus his story is not over This is Colonel Picquart Hes another highranking officer in the French Army and like most people he assumed Dreyfus was guilty Also like most people in the army he was at least casually antiSemitic But at a certain point Picquart began to suspect What if were all wrong about Dreyfus What happened was he had discovered evidence that the spying for Germany had continued even after Dreyfus was in prison And he had also discovered that another officer in the army had handwriting that perfectly matched the memo much closer than Dreyfuss handwriting So he brought these discoveries to his superiors but to his dismay they either didnt care or came up with elaborate rationalizations to explain his findings like Well all youve really shown Picquart is that theres another spy who learned how to mimic Dreyfuss handwriting and he picked up the torch of spying after Dreyfus left But Dreyfus is still guilty Eventually Picquart managed to get Dreyfus exonerated But it took him 10 years and for part of that time he himself was in prison for the crime of disloyalty to the army A lot of people feel like Picquart cant really be the hero of this story because he was an antiSemite and thats bad which I agree with But personally for me the fact that Picquart was antiSemitic actually makes his actions more admirable because he had the same prejudices the same reasons to be biased as his fellow officers but his motivation to find the truth and uphold it trumped all of that So to me Picquart is a poster child for what I call scout mindset Its the drive not to make one idea win or another lose but just to see whats really there as honestly and accurately as you can even if its not pretty or convenient or pleasant This mindset is what Im personally passionate about And Ive spent the last few years examining and trying to figure out what causes scout mindset Why are some people sometimes at least able to cut through their own prejudices and biases and motivations and just try to see the facts and the evidence as objectively as they can And the answer is emotional So just as soldier mindset is rooted in emotions like defensiveness or tribalism scout mindset is too Its just rooted in different emotions For example scouts are curious Theyre more likely to say they feel pleasure when they learn new information or an itch to solve a puzzle Theyre more likely to feel intrigued when they encounter something that contradicts their expectations Scouts also have different values Theyre more likely to say they think its virtuous to test your own beliefs and theyre less likely to say that someone who changes his mind seems weak And above all scouts are grounded which means their selfworth as a person isnt tied to how right or wrong they are about any particular topic So they can believe that capital punishment works If studies come out showing that it doesnt they can say Huh Looks like I might be wrong Doesnt mean Im bad or stupid This cluster of traits is what researchers have found  and Ive also found anecdotally  predicts good judgment And the key takeaway I want to leave you with about those traits is that theyre primarily not about how smart you are or about how much you know In fact they dont correlate very much with IQ at all Theyre about how you feel Theres a quote that I keep coming back to by SaintExupéry Hes the author of The Little Prince He said If you want to build a ship dont drum up your men to collect wood and give orders and distribute the work Instead teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea In other words I claim if we really want to improve our judgment as individuals and as societies what we need most is not more instruction in logic or rhetoric or probability or economics even though those things are quite valuable But what we most need to use those principles well is scout mindset We need to change the way we feel We need to learn how to feel proud instead of ashamed when we notice we might have been wrong about something We need to learn how to feel intrigued instead of defensive when we encounter some information that contradicts our beliefs So the question I want to leave you with is What do you most yearn for Do you yearn to defend your own beliefs Or do you yearn to see the world as clearly as you possibly can Thank youHi everyone Gosh I wish I could dance but I cant and you really dont want me to So instead I thought I would talk a little today about how people think Im fascinated by this question Im a social psychologist which basically means Im a professional people watcher So this is what I do I try to figure out how humans think and how we might be able to think better Heres something I noticed a few years ago about how I seem to think heres a typical week in my life which usually seems to revolve entirely around publishing papers So here I am at maximum of my artistic abilities as a stick figure going along at baseline and a paper gets accepted I get this rush this blip of happiness and then Im back to baseline by about lunch time A few days later a paper might get rejected and that feels pretty awful And I wait for that blip to end but somehow I just cant stop thinking about it Heres the craziest part even if another paper gets accepted the next day well thats nice but somehow I cant get that pesky rejection out of my head So what is going on here Why does a failure seem to stick in our minds so much longer than a success Together with my colleague Amber Boydstun in the Political Science Department I started thinking about this question this question of do our minds get stuck in the negatives We all know intuitively that there are different ways of thinking about things The same glass the saying goes can be seen as halffull or halfempty Theres a lot of research in the social sciences showing that depending on how you describe the glass to people as halffull or halfempty it changes how they feel about it So if you describe the glass as halffull this is called the gain frame because youre focusing on whats gained then people like it But if you describe the same glass as halfempty a loss frame then people dont like it But we wondered what happens when you try to switch from thinking about it one way to thinking about it another way Can people shift back and forth or do they get stuck in one way of thinking about it Does one of these labels in other words tend to stick more in the mind Well to investigate this question we conducted a simple experiment We told participants in our experiment about a new surgical procedure and we randomly assigned them to one of two conditions For participants in the first condition the first group we described the surgical procedure in terms of gains we said it had a 70 success rate For participants in the second group we described the procedure in terms of losses we said it had a 30 failure rate So its the exact same procedure were just focusing peoples attention on the part of the glass thats full or the part of the glass thats empty Perhaps unsurprisingly people like the procedure when its described as having a 70 success rate and they dont like it when its described as having a 30 failure rate But then we added a twist we told participants in the first group You know you could think of this as a 30 failure rate And now they dont like it anymore theyve changed their minds We told participants in the second group You know you could think of this as a 70 success rate but unlike the first group they stuck with their initial opinion they seemed to be stuck in the initial loss frame that they saw at the beginning of the study We conducted another experiment This time we told participants about the current governor of an important state who is running for reelection against his opponent We again had two groups of participants and we described the current governors track record to them in one of two ways We said that when the current governor took office statewide budget cuts were expected to affect of about 10000 jobs and then half of the participants read that under the current governors leadership 40 of these jobs had been saved They like the current governor they think he is doing a great job The rest of the participants read that under the current governors leadership 60 of these jobs had been lost and they dont like the current governor they think hes doing a terrible job But then once more we added a twist For participants in the first group we reframed the information in terms of losses and now they didnt like the current governor anymore For participants in the second group we reframed the information in terms of gains but just like in the first study this didnt seem to matter People in this group still didnt like the current governor So notice what this means Once the loss frame gets in there it sticks People cant go back to thinking about jobs saved once they thought about jobs lost So in both of these scenarios actually the current governor gets ousted in favor of his opponent At this point we were getting curious why does this happen Could it be that its actually mentally harder for people to convert from losses to gains than it is for them to go from gains to losses So we conducted the third study to test how easily people could covert from one frame to another This time we told participants Imagine theres been an outbreak of an unusual disease and six hundred lives are at stake We asked participants in one group If a hundred lives are saved how many will be lost And we asked participants in the other group If a hundred lives are lost how many will be saved So everyone just has to calculate 600 minus 100 and come up with the answer of 500 but whereas people in one group have to convert from gains to losses in order to do that people in the second group have to convert from losses to gains We timed how long it took them to solve this simple math problem and what we found was that when people had to convert from gains to losses they could solve the problem quite quickly it took them about 7 seconds on average But when they had to convert from losses to gains well now it took them far longer almost 11 seconds So this suggests that once we think about something as a loss that way of thinking about it tends to stick in our heads and to resist our attempts to change it What I take away from this research and from related research is that our view of the world has a fundamental tendency to tilt toward the negative Its pretty easy to go from good to bad but far harder to shift from bad to good We literally have to work harder to see the upside of things And this matters So think about the economy Heres economic wellbeing from 2007 to 2010 You can see it tanked just like we all remember and then by late 2010 it has recovered by most objective measures But heres consumer confidence over the same time period You can see it tanks right along with the economy but then it seems to get stuck Instead of rebounding with the economy itself consumers seem to be psychologically stuck back there in the recession So oddly then it may take more effort to change our minds about how the economy is doing then to change the economy itself On the more personal level what this research means to me is that you have to work to see the upside Literally this takes work this takes effort And you can practice this you can train your mind to do this better Theres research out at UC Davis showing that just writing for a few minutes each day about things that youre grateful for can dramatically boost your happiness and wellbeing and even your health We can also rehearse good news and share it with others We tend to think right that misery loves company that venting will help get rid of our negative emotions that well feel better if we just talk about how terrible our day was And so we talk and we talk and we talk about the boss who’s driving us crazy and that friend who never called us back and that meeting at work where every little thing that could go wrong did But we forget to talk about the good stuff And yet thats exactly where our minds need the most practice So my husband who has this disconcerting habit of listening to what I say other people should do and then pointing out that technically speaking Im a person too has taken to listening to me for about two minutes on days when I come home all grumpy and complaining about everything and he listens and he says Okay but what happened today that was good So I tell him about the student who came up to me after class with this really interesting insightful question and I tell him about the friend who emailed me out of the blue this morning just to say hello And somewhere in the telling I start to smile and I start to think that maybe my day was pretty decent after all I think we can also work in our communities to focus on the upside We can be more aware that bad tends to stick One mean comment can stick with somebody all day all week even and bad tends to propagate itself right Somebody snaps at you and you snap back and you snap at the next guy too But what if the next time somebody snapped at you you forgave them What if the next time you had a really grumpy waitress you left her an extra large tip Our minds may be built to look for negative information and to hold on to it but we can also retrain our minds if we put some effort into it and start to see that the glass may be a little more full than we initially thought Thank youAt every stage of our lives we make decisions that will profoundly influence the lives of the people were going to become and then when we become those people were not always thrilled with the decisions we made So young people pay good money to get tattoos removed that teenagers paid good money to get Middleaged people rushed to divorce people who young adults rushed to marry Older adults work hard to lose what middleaged adults worked hard to gain On and on and on The question is as a psychologist that fascinates me is why do we make decisions that our future selves so often regret Now I think one of the reasons  Ill try to convince you today — is that we have a fundamental misconception about the power of time Every one of you knows that the rate of change slows over the human lifespan that your children seem to change by the minute but your parents seem to change by the year But what is the name of this magical point in life where change suddenly goes from a gallop to a crawl Is it teenage years Is it middle age Is it old age The answer it turns out for most people is now wherever now happens to be What I want to convince you today is that all of us are walking around with an illusion an illusion that history our personal history has just come to an end that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives Let me give you some data to back up that claim So heres a study of change in peoples personal values over time Heres three values Everybody here holds all of them but you probably know that as you grow as you age the balance of these values shifts So how does it do so Well we asked thousands of people We asked half of them to predict for us how much their values would change in the next 10 years and the others to tell us how much their values had changed in the last 10 years And this enabled us to do a really interesting kind of analysis because it allowed us to compare the predictions of people say 18 years old to the reports of people who were 28 and to do that kind of analysis throughout the lifespan Heres what we found First of all you are right change does slow down as we age but second youre wrong because it doesnt slow nearly as much as we think At every age from 18 to 68 in our data set people vastly underestimated how much change they would experience over the next 10 years We call this the end of history illusion To give you an idea of the magnitude of this effect you can connect these two lines and what you see here is that 18yearolds anticipate changing only as much as 50yearolds actually do Now its not just values Its all sorts of other things For example personality Many of you know that psychologists now claim that there are five fundamental dimensions of personality neuroticism openness to experience agreeableness extraversion and conscientiousness Again we asked people how much they expected to change over the next 10 years and also how much they had changed over the last 10 years and what we found well youre going to get used to seeing this diagram over and over because once again the rate of change does slow as we age but at every age people underestimate how much their personalities will change in the next decade And it isnt just ephemeral things like values and personality You can ask people about their likes and dislikes their basic preferences For example name your best friend your favorite kind of vacation whats your favorite hobby whats your favorite kind of music People can name these things We ask half of them to tell us Do you think that that will change over the next 10 years and half of them to tell us Did that change over the last 10 years And what we find well youve seen it twice now and here it is again people predict that the friend they have now is the friend theyll have in 10 years the vacation they most enjoy now is the one theyll enjoy in 10 years and yet people who are 10 years older all say Eh you know thats really changed Does any of this matter Is this just a form of misprediction that doesnt have consequences No it matters quite a bit and Ill give you an example of why It bedevils our decisionmaking in important ways Bring to mind right now for yourself your favorite musician today and your favorite musician 10 years ago I put mine up on the screen to help you along Now we asked people to predict for us to tell us how much money they would pay right now to see their current favorite musician perform in concert 10 years from now and on average people said they would pay 129 dollars for that ticket And yet when we asked them how much they would pay to see the person who was their favorite 10 years ago perform today they say only 80 dollars Now in a perfectly rational world these should be the same number but we overpay for the opportunity to indulge our current preferences because we overestimate their stability Why does this happen Were not entirely sure but it probably has to do with the ease of remembering versus the difficulty of imagining Most of us can remember who we were 10 years ago but we find it hard to imagine who were going to be and then we mistakenly think that because its hard to imagine its not likely to happen Sorry when people say I cant imagine that theyre usually talking about their own lack of imagination and not about the unlikelihood of the event that theyre describing The bottom line is time is a powerful force It transforms our preferences It reshapes our values It alters our personalities We seem to appreciate this fact but only in retrospect Only when we look backwards do we realize how much change happens in a decade Its as if for most of us the present is a magic time Its a watershed on the timeline Its the moment at which we finally become ourselves Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think theyre finished The person you are right now is as transient as fleeting and as temporary as all the people youve ever been The one constant in our life is change Thank youEvery year in the United States alone 2077000 couples make a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest of their lives together  And not to have sex with anyone else Ever He buys a ring she buys a dress They go shopping for all sorts of things She takes him to Arthur Murray for ballroomdancing lessons And the big day comes And theyll stand before God and family and some guy her dad once did business with and theyll vow that nothing  not abject poverty not lifethreatening illness not complete and utter misery  will ever put the tiniest damper on their eternal love and devotion These optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and midlife crises and a cumulative 50pound weight gain until that faroff day when one of them is finally able to rest in peace You know because they cant hear the snoring anymore And then theyll get stupid drunk and smash cake in each others faces and do the Macarena And well be there showering them with towels and toasters and drinking their free booze and throwing birdseed at them every single time  even though we know statistically half of them will be divorced within a decade Of course the other half wont right Theyll keep forgetting anniversaries and arguing about where to spend holidays and debating  Which way the toilet paper should come off of the roll And some of them will even still be enjoying each others company when neither of them can chew solid food anymore And researchers want to know why I mean look  it doesnt take a doubleblind placebocontrolled study to figure out what makes a marriage not work disrespect boredom too much time on Facebook having sex with other people But you can have the exact opposite of all of those things  respect excitement a broken Internet connection mindnumbing monogamy  and the thing still can go to hell in a handbasket So whats going on when it doesnt What do the folks who make it all the way to sidebyside burial plots have in common What are they doing right What can we learn from them And if youre still happily sleeping solo why should you stop what youre doing and make it your lifes work to find that one special person that you can annoy for the rest of your life Well researchers spend billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out They stalk blissful couples and study their every move and mannerism And they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends And it turns out the success stories share a few similarities beyond that they dont have sex with other people For instance in the happiest marriages the wife is thinner and betterlooking than the husband Obvious Right Its obvious that this leads to marital bliss because women  we care a great deal about being thin and goodlooking whereas men mostly care about sex ideally with women who are thinner and better looking than they are The beauty of this research though is that no one is suggesting that women have to be thin to be happy We just have to be thinner than our partners So instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising we just need to wait for them to get fat  Maybe bake a few pies This is good information to have and its not that complicated Research also suggests that the happiest couples are the ones that focus on the positives For example the happy wife Instead of pointing out her husbands growing gut or suggesting he go for a run she might say Wow honey thank you for going out of your way to make me relatively thinner These are couples who can find good in any situation Yeah it was devastating when we lost everything in that fire But its kind of nice sleeping out here under the stars And its a good thing youve got all that body fat to keep us warm One of my favorite studies found that the more willing a husband is to do housework the more attractive his wife will find him Because we needed a study to tell us this But heres whats going on here The more attractive she finds him the more sex they have the more sex they have the nicer he is to her the nicer he is to her the less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed and ultimately they live happily ever after In other words men you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department Heres an interesting one One study found that people who smile in childhood photographs are less likely to get a divorce This is an actual study and let me clarify the researchers were not looking at documented selfreports of childhood happiness or even studying old journals The data were based entirely on whether people looked happy in these early pictures Now I dont know how old all of you are but when I was a kid your parents took pictures with a special kind of camera that held something called film And by God film was expensive They didnt take 300 shots of you in that rapidfire digital video mode and then pick out the nicest smiliest one for the Christmas card Oh no They dressed you up they lined you up and you smiled for the fucking camera like they told you to or you could kiss your birthday party goodbye But still I have a huge pile of fake happy childhood pictures and Im glad they make me less likely than some people to get a divorce So what else can you do to safeguard your marriage Do not win an Oscar for best actress Im serious Bettie Davis Joan Crawford Halle Berry Hilary Swank Sandra Bullock Reese Witherspoon  all of them single soon after taking home that statue They actually call it the Oscar curse It is the marriage kiss of death and something that should be avoided And its not just successfully starring in films thats dangerous It turns out merely watching a romantic comedy causes relationship satisfaction to plummet Apparently the bitter realization that maybe it could happen to us but it obviously hasnt and it probably never will makes our lives seem unbearably grim in comparison And theoretically I suppose if we opt for a film where someone gets brutally murdered or dies in a fiery car crash we are more likely to walk out of that theater feeling like weve got it pretty good Drinking alcohol it seems is bad for your marriage Yeah I cant tell you anymore about that one because I stopped reading it at the headline But heres a scary one divorce is contagious Thats right when you have a close couple friend split up it increases your chances of getting a divorce by 75 percent Now I have to say I dont get this one at all My husband and I have watched quite a few friends divide their assets and then struggle with being our age and single in an age of sexting and Viagra and eHarmony And Im thinking theyve done more for my marriage than a lifetime of therapy ever could So now you may be wondering Why does anyone get married ever Well the US federal government counts more than a thousand legal benefits to being someones spouse A list that includes visitation rights in jail but hopefully youll never need that one But beyond the profound federal perks married people make more money Were healthier physically and emotionally We produce happier more stable and more successful kids We have more sex than our supposedly swinging single friends believe it or not We even live longer which is a pretty compelling argument for marrying someone you like a lot in the first place Now if youre not currently experiencing the joy of the joint tax return I cant tell you how to find a choreloving person of the approximately ideal size and attractiveness who prefers horror movies and doesnt have a lot of friends hovering on the brink of divorce but I can only encourage you to try because the benefits as Ive pointed out are significant The bottom line is whether youre in it or youre searching for it I believe marriage is an institution worth pursuing and protecting So I hope youll use the information Ive given you today to weigh your personal strengths against your own risk factors For instance in my marriage Id say Im doing OK One the one hand I have a husband whos annoyingly lean and incredibly handsome So Im obviously going to need fatten him up And like I said we have those divorced friends who may secretly or subconsciously be trying to break us up So we have to keep an eye on that And we do like a cocktail or two On the other hand I have the fake happy picture thing And also my husband does a lot around the house and would happily never see another romantic comedy as long as he lives So Ive got all those things going for me But just in case I plan to work extra hard to not win an Oscar anytime soon And for the good of your relationships I would encourage you to do the same Ill see you at the barIm really really really excited to be here I kind of want to tell you a little bit more of the  I dont want to say basics  because we really dont know anything about my syndrome I was born with this very rare syndrome that only two other people in the world including myself that we know of have Basically what this syndrome causes is that I cannot gain weight Yes it does sound as good as it is I could eat absolutely whatever I want whenever I want and I wont really gain any weight Im going to be 25 in March and Ive never weighed over about 64 pounds in my entire life When I was in college I hid  well I didnt hide it everyone knew it was there  but it was a giant tub of Twinkies donuts chips Skittles and my roommate would say I could hear you at am reaching under your bed to get food But Im like You know what Its alright I can do these things Because there are benefits to this syndrome There are benefits to not being able to gain weight There are benefits to being visually impaired There are benefits to being kind of really small A lot of people think Lizzie how in the world are you saying there are benefits when you can only see out of one eye Well let me tell you what the benefits are because they are great I wear contactsconTACT Halfoff conTACTS When I wear my reading glasses halfoff prescription If somebody is annoying me being rude Stand on my right side Its like youre not even there I dont even know youre standing there Right now if I stand like this I have no clue that theres this whole side of the room Also being small I am very willing to volunteer myself to go to Weight Watchers or to some gym and say Hi Im Lizzie I will be your poster child Put my face on whatever you need and I will say Hi I used this program Look how well it worked Even though there are amazing things that have come from this syndrome there are also things that have been very very difficult as you can imagine Growing up I was raised 150 normally I was my parents first child And when I was born the doctors told my mom Your daughter has no amniotic fluid around her At all So when I was born it was a miracle that I came out screaming The doctors told my parents We just want to warn you Expect your daughter to never be able to talk walk crawl think or do anything by herself Now as firsttime parents you would think that my parents would say Oh no Why Why are we getting our first child with all these unknown problems But thats not what they did The first thing they told the doctor was We want to see her and we are going to take her home and love her and raise her to the best of our abilities And thats what they did I credit pretty much everything that Ive done in my life to my parents My dad is here with me today and my mom is at home watching Hi mom Shes recovering from surgery She has been the glue thats held our family together and shes given me the strength to see that shes going through so much but she has this fighting spirit that shes instilled in me so that I have proudly been able to stand in front of people and say You know what Ive had a really difficult life But thats okay Thats okay Things have been scary things have been tough One of the biggest things that I had to deal with growing up was something Im pretty sure every single one of us in this room has dealt with before Can you guess what that is It starts with a B Can you guys guess it Audience Boys Lizzie Boys Bullying I know what you all are thinking Why cant I sit here with them I had to deal with bullying a lot but as I said I was raised very normally so when I started kindergarten I had absolutely no idea that I looked different No clue I couldnt see that I looked different from other kids I think of it as a big slap of reality for a five yearold because I went in to school the first day deckedout in Pocahontas gear I was ready I went in with my backpack that looked like a turtle shell because it was bigger than me and I walked up to a little girl and smiled at her and she looked up at me like I was a monster like I was the scariest thing she had ever seen in her life My first reaction was She is really rude I am a fun kid and shes the one missing out So Ill just go over here and play with blocks Or boys I thought the day would get better and unfortunately it didnt The day got worse and worse A lot of people just wanted to have absolutely nothing to do with me and I couldnt understand why Why What did I do I didnt do anything to them In my mind I was still a really cool kid I had to go home and ask my parents Whats wrong with me What did I do Why dont they like me They sat me down and said Lizzie the only thing different about you is that youre smaller than the other kids You have this syndrome but its not going to define who you are They said Go to school pick your head up smile continue to be yourself and people will see that youre just like them And so thats what I did I want you to think and ask yourself this in your head right now What defines you Who are you Is it where you come from Is it your background Is it your friends What is it What defines who you are as a person Its taken me a very long time to figure out what defines me For so long I thought what defined me was my outer appearance I thought that my little tiny legs and my little arms and my little face were ugly I thought I was disgusting I hated when Id wake up in the morning when I was going to middle school and would be looking in the mirror getting ready and thinking Can I just scrub this syndrome off It would make my life so much easier if I could just scrub it off I could look like other kids I wouldnt have to buy clothes that had Dora the Explorer on them I wouldnt have to buy stuff that was Bedazzled when I was trying to be like the cool kids I would wish and pray and hope and do whatever I could so I would wake up in the morning and be different and I wouldnt have to deal with these struggles Its what I wanted every single day and every single day I was disappointed I have an amazing support system around me who never pity me who are there to pick me up if Im sad who are there to laugh with me during the good times and they taught me that even though I have this syndrome even though things are hard I cant let that define me My life was put into my hands just like your lives are put into yours You are the person in the front seat of your car You are the one who decides whether your car goes down a bad path or a good path You are the one who decides what defines you Now let me tell you it could be really hard to figure out what defines you because there were times when Id get so annoyed and frustrated and say I dont care what defines me When I was in high school I found a video unfortunately that somebody posted of me labeling me the worlds ugliest woman There were over four million views to this video eight seconds long no sound thousands of comments people saying Lizzie please  please  just do the world a favor put a gun to your head and kill yourself Think about that if people told you that if strangers told you this I cried my eyes out of course and I was ready to fight back and something kind of clicked in my head and I thought Im just going to leave it alone I started realizing that my life is in my hands I could either choose to make this really good or I could choose to make this really bad I could be grateful and open my eyes and realize the things that I do have and make those the things that define me I cant see out of one eye but I can see out of the other I might get sick a lot but I have really nice hair You do you do Thanks You guys are like the best little section right here You made me lose my train of thought Okay where was I Audience Your hair Hair Hair Ok ok thank you Thank you thank you thank you So I could either choose to be happy or I could choose to be upset with what I have and still kind of complain about it but then I started realizing Am I going to let the people who called me a monster define me Am I going to let the people who said Kill it with fire define me No Im going to let my goals and my success and my accomplishments be the things that define me  Not my outer appearance not the fact that Im visually impaired not the fact that I have this syndrome that nobody knows what it is So I told myself Im going to work my butt off and do whatever I could to make myself better because in my mind the best way that I could get back at all those people who made fun of me who teased me who called me ugly who called me a monster was to make myself better and to show them You know what Tell me those negative things Im going to turn them around and Im going to use them as a ladder to climb up to my goals Thats what I did I told myself that I wanted to be a motivational speaker I wanted to write a book graduate college have my own family and have my own career Eight years later I’m standing in front of you still doing motivational speaking First thing I accomplished it I wanted to write a book in a couple of weeks I will be submitting the manuscript for my third book I wanted to graduate college and I just finished college Im getting a degree in Communication Studies from Texas State University in San Marcos and I have a minor in English I really really tried to use reallife experience while I was getting my degree and my professors were not having it I wanted to have lastly my own family and my own career The family part is kind of down the line and my career part I feel like Im really doing well with it considering the fact that when I decided I wanted to be a motivational speaker I went home I sat in front of my laptop went to Google and typed in How to be a motivational speaker Im not even joking I worked my butt off I used the people who were telling me that I couldnt do this to motivate me I used their negativity to light my fire to keep going Use that Use that Use that negativity that you have in your life to make yourself better because I guarantee you  guarantee you  You will win Now I want to end with asking you again I want you to leave here and ask yourself what defines you But remember Brave starts here Thank youWhen I was in my 20s I saw my very first psychotherapy client I was a PhD student in clinical psychology at Berkeley She was a 26yearold woman named Alex Now Alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top and she dropped onto the couch in my office and kicked off her flats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems Now when I heard this I was so relieved My classmate got an arsonist for her first client And I got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys This I thought I could handle But I didnt handle it With the funny stories that Alex would bring to session it was easy for me just to nod my head while we kicked the can down the road Thirtys the new 20 Alex would say and as far as I could tell she was right Work happened later marriage happened later kids happened later even death happened later Twentysomethings like Alex and I had nothing but time But before long my supervisor pushed me to push Alex about her love life I pushed back I said Sure shes dating down shes sleeping with a knucklehead but its not like shes going to marry the guy And then my supervisor said Not yet but she might marry the next one Besides the best time to work on Alexs marriage is before she has one Thats what psychologists call an Aha moment That was the moment I realized 30 is not the new 20 Yes people settle down later than they used to but that didnt make Alexs 20s a developmental downtime That made Alexs 20s a developmental sweet spot and we were sitting there blowing it That was when I realized that this sort of benign neglect was a real problem and it had real consequences not just for Alex and her love life but for the careers and the families and the futures of twentysomethings everywhere There are 50 million twentysomethings in the United States right now Were talking about 15 percent of the population or 100 percent if you consider that no ones getting through adulthood without going through their 20s first Raise your hand if youre in your 20s I really want to see some twentysomethings here Oh yay You are all awesome If you work with twentysomethings you love a twentysomething youre losing sleep over twentysomethings I want to see — Okay Awesome twentysomethings really matter So I specialize in twentysomethings because I believe that every single one of those 50 million twentysomethings deserves to know what psychologists sociologists neurologists and fertility specialists already know that claiming your 20s is one of the simplest yet most transformative things you can do for work for love for your happiness maybe even for the world This is not my opinion These are the facts We know that 80 percent of lifes most defining moments take place by age 35 That means that eight out of 10 of the decisions and experiences and Aha moments that make your life what it is will have happened by your mid30s People who are over 40 dont panic This crowd is going to be fine I think We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on how much money youre going to earn We know that more than half of Americans are married or are living with or dating their future partner by 30 We know that the brain caps off its second and last growth spurt in your 20s as it rewires itself for adulthood which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself now is the time to change it We know that personality changes more during your 20s than at any other time in life and we know that female fertility peaks at age 28 and things get tricky after age 35 So your 20s are the time to educate yourself about your body and your options So when we think about child development we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain Its a time when your ordinary daytoday life has an inordinate impact on who you will become But what we hear less about is that theres such a thing as adult development and our 20s are that critical period of adult development But this isnt what twentysomethings are hearing Newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood Researchers call the 20s an extended adolescence Journalists coin silly nicknames for twentysomethings like twixters and kidults Its true As a culture we have trivialized what is actually the defining decade of adulthood Leonard Bernstein said that to achieve great things you need a plan and not quite enough time Isnt that true So what do you think happens when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say You have 10 extra years to start your life Nothing happens You have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition and absolutely nothing happens And then every day smart interesting twentysomethings like you or like your sons and daughters come into my office and say things like this I know my boyfriends no good for me but this relationship doesnt count Im just killing time Or they say Everybody says as long as I get started on a career by the time Im 30 Ill be fine But then it starts to sound like this My 20s are almost over and I have nothing to show for myself I had a better résumé the day after I graduated from college And then it starts to sound like this Dating in my 20s was like musical chairs Everybody was running around and having fun but then sometime around 30 it was like the music turned off and everybody started sitting down I didnt want to be the only one left standing up so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair to me at 30 Where are the twentysomethings here Do not do that Okay now that sounds a little flip but make no mistake the stakes are very high When a lot has been pushed to your 30s there is enormous thirtysomething pressure to jumpstart a career pick a city partner up and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time Many of these things are incompatible and as research is just starting to show simply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our 30s The postmillennial midlife crisis isnt buying a red sports car Its realizing you cant have that career you now want Its realizing you cant have that child you now want or you cant give your child a sibling Too many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings look at themselves and at me sitting across the room and say about their 20s What was I doing What was I thinking I want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking Heres a story about how that can go Its a story about a woman named Emma At 25 Emma came to my office because she was in her words having an identity crisis She said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment but she hadnt decided yet so shed spent the last few years waiting tables instead Because it was cheaper she lived with a boyfriend who displayed his temper more than his ambition And as hard as her 20s were her early life had been even harder She often cried in our sessions but then would collect herself by saying You cant pick your family but you can pick your friends Well one day Emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap and she sobbed for most of the hour Shed just bought a new address book and shed spent the morning filling in her many contacts but then shed been left staring at that empty blank that comes after the words In case of emergency please call  She was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said Whos going to be there for me if I get in a car wreck Whos going to take care of me if I have cancer Now in that moment it took everything I had not to say I will But what Emma needed wasnt some therapist who really really cared Emma needed a better life and I knew this was her chance I had learned too much since I first worked with Alex to just sit there while Emmas defining decade went parading by So over the next weeks and months I told Emma three things that every twentysomething male or female deserves to hear First I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital By get identity capital I mean do something that adds value to who you are Do something thats an investment in who you might want to be next I didnt know the future of Emmas career and no one knows the future of work but I do know this Identity capital begets identity capital So now is the time for that crosscountry job that internship that startup you want to try Im not discounting twentysomething exploration here but I am discounting exploration thats not supposed to count which by the way is not exploration Thats procrastination I told Emma to explore work and make it count Second I told Emma that the urban tribe is overrated Best friends are great for giving rides to the airport but twentysomethings who huddle together with likeminded peers limit who they know what they know how they think how they speak and where they work That new piece of capital that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle New things come from what are called our weak ties our friends of friends of friends So yes half of twentysomethings are un or underemployed But half arent and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group Half of new jobs are never posted so reaching out to your neighbors boss is how you get that unposted job Its not cheating Its the science of how information spreads Last but not least Emma believed that you cant pick your family but you can pick your friends Now this was true for her growing up but as a twentysomething soon Emma would pick her family when she partnered with someone and created a family of her own I told Emma the time to start picking your family is now Now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you But grabbing whoever youre living with or sleeping with when everyone on Facebook starts walking down the aisle is not progress The best time to work on your marriage is before you have one and that means being as intentional with love as you are with work Picking your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want rather than just making it work or killing time with whoever happens to be choosing you So what happened to Emma Well we went through that address book and she found an old roommates cousin who worked at an art museum in another state That weak tie helped her get a job there That job offer gave her the reason to leave that livein boyfriend Now five years later shes a special events planner for museums Shes married to a man she mindfully chose She loves her new career she loves her new family and she sent me a card that said Now the emergency contact blanks dont seem big enough Now Emmas story made that sound easy but thats what I love about working with twentysomethings They are so easy to help Twentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving LAX bound for somewhere west Right after takeoff a slight change in course is the difference between landing in Alaska or Fiji Likewise at 21 or 25 or even 29 one good conversation one good break one good TED Talk can have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come So heres an idea worth spreading to every twentysomething you know Its as simple as what I learned to say to Alex Its what I now have the privilege of saying to twentysomethings like Emma every single day Thirty is not the new 20 so claim your adulthood get some identity capital use your weak ties pick your family Dont be defined by what you didnt know or didnt do Youre deciding your life right now Thank youSo I didnt always make my living from music For about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university this was my day job footnote footnote I was a selfemployed living statue called the EightFoot Bride and I love telling people I did this for a job because everybody always wants to know who are these freaks in real life Hello I painted myself white one day stood on a box put a hat or a can at my feet and when someone came by and dropped in money I handed them a flower  and some intense eye contact And if they didnt take the flower I threw in a gesture of sadness and longing  as they walked away So I had the most profound encounters with people especially lonely people who looked like they hadnt talked to anyone in weeks and we would get this beautiful moment of prolonged eye contact being allowed in a city street and we would sort of fall in love a little bit And my eyes would say  Thank you I see you And their eyes would say  Nobody ever sees me Thank you footnote footnote I would get harassed sometimes People would yell at me from their cars Get a job And Id be like This is my job But it hurt because it made me fear that I was somehow doing something unjoblike and unfair shameful I had no idea how perfect a real education I was getting for the music business on this box And for the economists out there you may be interested to know I actually made a pretty predictable income which was shocking to me given I had no regular customers but pretty much 60 bucks on a Tuesday 90 bucks on a Friday It was consistent footnote footnote And meanwhile I was touring locally and playing in nightclubs with my band the Dresden Dolls This was me on piano a genius drummer I wrote the songs and eventually we started making enough money that I could quit being a statue and as we started touring I really didnt want to lose this sense of direct connection with people because I loved it So after all of our shows we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people and we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us and I would track down local musicians and artists and they would set up outside of our shows and they would pass the hat and then they would come in and join us onstage so we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird random circus guests footnote footnote And then Twitter came along and made things even more magic because I could ask instantly for anything anywhere So I would need a piano to practice on and an hour later I would be at a fans house This is in London People would bring homecooked food to us all over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us This is in Seattle Fans who worked in museums and stores and any kind of public space would wave their hands if I would decide to do a lastminute spontaneous free gig This is a library in Auckland On Saturday I tweeted for this crate and hat because I did not want to schlep them from the East Coast and they showed up care of this dude Chris from Newport Beach who says hello I once tweeted Where in Melbourne can I buy a neti pot And a nurse from a hospital drove one right at that moment to the cafe I was in and I bought her a smoothie and we sat there talking about nursing and death And I love this kind of random closeness which is lucky because I do a lot of couchsurfing In mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room but theres no wireless and in punk squats everyone on the floor in one room with no toilets but with wireless clearly making it the better option footnote footnote My crew once pulled our van up to a really poor Miami neighborhood and we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night was an 18yearold girl still living at home and her family were all undocumented immigrants from Honduras And that night her whole family took the couches and she slept together with her mom so that we could take their beds And I lay there thinking these people have so little Is this fair And in the morning her mom taught us how to try to make tortillas and wanted to give me a Bible and she took me aside and she said to me in her broken English Your music has helped my daughter so much Thank you for staying here Were all so grateful And I thought this is fair This is this A couple of months later I was in Manhattan and I tweeted for a crash pad and at midnight Im on the Lower East Side and it occurs to me Ive never actually done this alone Ive always been with my band or my crew Is this what stupid people do Is this how stupid people die And before I can change my mind the door busts open Shes an artist Hes a financial blogger for Reuters and theyre pouring me a glass of red wine and offering me a bath and I have had thousands of nights like that and like that footnote footnote So I couchsurf a lot I also crowdsurf a lot I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing Youre falling into the audience and youre trusting each other I once asked an opening band of mine if they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat to get some extra money something that I did a lot And as usual the band was psyched but there was this one guy in the band who told me he just couldnt bring himself to go out there It felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat And I recognized his fear of Is this fair and Get a job And meanwhile my band is becoming bigger and bigger We sign with a major label And our music is a cross between punk and cabaret Its not for everybody Well maybe its for you We sign and theres all this hype leading up to our next record And it comes out and it sells about 25000 copies in the first few weeks and the label considers this a failure I was like 25000 isnt that a lot They said No the sales are going down Its a failure And they walk off footnote footnote Right at this same time Im signing and hugging after a gig and a guy comes up to me and hands me a 10 bill and he says Im sorry I burned your CD from a friend But I read your blog I know you hate your label I just want you to have this money footnote footnote And this starts happening all the time I become the hat after my own gigs but I have to physically stand there and take the help from people and unlike the guy in the opening band Ive actually had a lot of practice standing there Thank you footnote footnote And this is the moment I decide Im just going to give away my music for free online whenever possible so its like Metallica over here Napster bad Amanda Palmer over here and Im going to encourage torrenting downloading sharing but Im going to ask for help because I saw it work on the street So I fought my way off my label and for my next project with my new band the Grand Theft Orchestra I turned to crowdfunding And I fell into those thousands of connections that Id made and I asked my crowd to catch me And the goal was 100000 dollars My fans backed me at nearly 12 million which was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date And you can see how many people it is Its about 25000 people footnote footnote And the media asked Amanda the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy How did you make all these people pay for music And the real answer is I didnt make them I asked them And through the very act of asking people Id connected with them and when you connect with them people want to help you Its kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists They dont want to ask for things But its not easy Its not easy to ask And a lot of artists have a problem with this Asking makes you vulnerable footnote footnote And I got a lot of criticism online after my Kickstarter went big for continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices specifically for asking musicians who are fans if they wanted to join us on stage for a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer and this was a doctored image that went up of me on a website And this hurt in a really familiar way And people saying Youre not allowed anymore to ask for that kind of help really reminded me of the people in their cars yelling Get a job Because they werent with us on the sidewalk and they couldnt see the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them So this is slightly not safe for work This is my Kickstarter backer party in Berlin At the end of the night I stripped and let everyone draw on me Now let me tell you if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers  I recommend this especially if those strangers are drunk German people This was a ninja masterlevel fan connection because what I was really saying here was I trust you this much Should I Show me For most of human history musicians artists theyve been part of the community Connectors and openers not untouchable stars Celebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a distance but the Internet and the content that were freely able to share on it are taking us back Its about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough So a lot of people are confused by the idea of no hard sticker price They see it as an unpredictable risk but the things Ive done the Kickstarter the street the doorbell I dont see these things as risk I see them as trust Now the online tools to make the exchange as easy and as instinctive as the street theyre getting there But the perfect tools arent going to help us if we cant face each other and give and receive fearlessly but more important  to ask without shame My music career has been spent trying to encounter people on the Internet the way I could on the box So blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates and my new video but about our work and our art and our fears and our hangovers our mistakes and we see each other And I think when we really see each other we want to help each other footnote footnote I think people have been obsessed with the wrong question which is How do we make people pay for music What if we started asking How do we let people pay for music Thank youSo I didnt always make my

who says hello I once tweeted Where in Melbourne can I buy a neti pot And a nurse from a hospital drove one right at that moment to the cafe I was in and I bought her a smoothie and we sat there talking about nursing and death And I love this kind of random closeness which is lucky because I do a lot of couchsurfing In mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room but theres no wireless and in punk squats everyone on the floor in one room with no toilets but with wireless clearly making it the better option footnote footnote My crew once pulled our van up to a really poor Miami neighborhood and we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night was an 18yearold girl still living at home and her family were all undocumented immigrants from Honduras And that night her whole family took the couches and she slept together with her mom so that we could take their beds And I lay there thinking these people have so little Is this fair And in the morning her mom taught us how to try to make tortillas and wanted to give me a Bible and she took me aside and she said to me in her broken English Your music has helped my daughter so much Thank you for staying here Were all so grateful And I thought this is fair This is this A couple of months later I was in Manhattan and I tweeted for a crash pad and at midnight Im on the Lower East Side and it occurs to me Ive never actually done this alone Ive always been with my band or my crew Is this what stupid people do Is this how stupid people die And before I can change my mind the door busts open Shes an artist Hes a financial blogger for Reuters and theyre pouring me a glass of red wine and offering me a bath and I have had thousands of nights like that and like that footnote footnote So I couchsurf a lot I also crowdsurf a lot I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing Youre falling into the audience and youre trusting each other I once asked an opening band of mine if they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat to get some extra money something that I did a lot And as usual the band was psyched but there was this one guy in the band who told me he just couldnt bring himself to go out there It felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat And I recognized his fear of Is this fair and Get a job And meanwhile my band is becoming bigger and bigger We sign with a major label And our music is a cross between punk and cabaret Its not for everybody Well maybe its for you We sign and theres all this hype leading up to our next record And it comes out and it sells about 25000 copies in the first few weeks and the label considers this a failure I was like 25000 isnt that a lot They said No the sales are going down Its a failure And they walk off footnote footnote Right at this same time Im signing and hugging after a gig and a guy comes up to me and hands me a 10 bill and he says Im sorry I burned your CD from a friend But I read your blog I know you hate your label I just want you to have this money footnote footnote And this starts happening all the time I become the hat after my own gigs but I have to physically stand there and take the help from people and unlike the guy in the opening band Ive actually had a lot of practice standing there Thank you footnote footnote And this is the moment I decide Im just going to give away my music for free online whenever possible so its like Metallica over here Napster bad Amanda Palmer over here and Im going to encourage torrenting downloading sharing but Im going to ask for help because I saw it work on the street So I fought my way off my label and for my next project with my new band the Grand Theft Orchestra I turned to crowdfunding And I fell into those thousands of connections that Id made and I asked my crowd to catch me And the goal was 100000 dollars My fans backed me at nearly 12 million which was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date And you can see how many people it is Its about 25000 people footnote footnote And the media asked Amanda the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy How did you make all these people pay for music And the real answer is I didnt make them I asked them And through the very act of asking people Id connected with them and when you connect with them people want to help you Its kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists They dont want to ask for things But its not easy Its not easy to ask And a lot of artists have a problem with this Asking makes you vulnerable footnote footnote And I got a lot of criticism online after my Kickstarter went big for continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices specifically for asking musicians who are fans if they wanted to join us on stage for a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer and this was a doctored image that went up of me on a website And this hurt in a really familiar way And people saying Youre not allowed anymore to ask for that kind of help really reminded me of the people in their cars yelling Get a job Because they werent with us on the sidewalk and they couldnt see the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them So this is slightly not safe for work This is my Kickstarter backer party in Berlin At the end of the night I stripped and let everyone draw on me Now let me tell you if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers  I recommend this especially if those strangers are drunk German people This was a ninja masterlevel fan connection because what I was really saying here was I trust you this much Should I Show me For most of human history musicians artists theyve been part of the community Connectors and openers not untouchable stars Celebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a distance but the Internet and the content that were freely able to share on it are taking us back Its about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough So a lot of people are confused by the idea of no hard sticker price They see it as an unpredictable risk but the things Ive done the Kickstarter the street the doorbell I dont see these things as risk I see them as trust Now the online tools to make the exchange as easy and as instinctive as the street theyre getting there But the perfect tools arent going to help us if we cant face each other and give and receive fearlessly but more important  to ask without shame My music career has been spent trying to encounter people on the Internet the way I could on the box So blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates and my new video but about our work and our art and our fears and our hangovers our mistakes and we see each other And I think when we really see each other we want to help each other footnote footnote I think people have been obsessed with the wrong question which is How do we make people pay for music What if we started asking How do we let people pay for music Thank youSo this happy pic of me was taken in 1999 I was a senior in college and it was right after a dance practice I was really really happy And I remember exactly where I was about a week and a half later I was sitting in the back of my used minivan in a campus parking lot when I decided I was going to commit suicide I went from deciding to fullblown planning very quickly And I came this close to the edge of the precipice Its the closest Ive ever come And the only reason I took my finger off the trigger was thanks to a few lucky coincidences And after the fact thats what scared me the most the element of chance So I became very methodical about testing different ways that I could manage my ups and downs which has proven to be a good investment Many normal people might have say six to 10 major depressive episodes in their lives I have bipolar depression It runs in my family Ive had 50plus at this point and Ive learned a lot Ive had a lot of atbats many rounds in the ring with darkness taking good notes So I thought rather than get up and give any type of recipe for success or highlight reel I would share my recipe for avoiding selfdestruction and certainly selfparalysis And the tool Ive found which has proven to be the most reliable safety net for emotional free fall is actually the same tool that has helped me to make my best business decisions But that is secondary And it is  stoicism That sounds boring You might think of Spock or it might conjure and image like this  a cow standing in the rain Its not sad Its not particularly happy Its just an impassive creature taking whatever life sends its way You might not think of the ultimate competitor say Bill Belichick head coach of the New England Patriots who has the alltime NFL record for Super Bowl titles And stoicism has spread like wildfire in the top of the NFL ranks as a means of mental toughness training in the last few years You might not think of the Founding Fathers  Thomas Jefferson John Adams George Washington to name but three students of stoicism George Washington actually had a play about a Stoic  this was Cato a Tragedy  performed for his troops at Valley Forge to keep them motivated So why would people of action focus so much on an ancient philosophy This seems very academic I would encourage you to think about stoicism a little bit differently as an operating system for thriving in highstress environments for making better decisions And it all started here kind of on a porch So around 300 BC in Athens someone named Zeno of Citium taught many lectures walking around a painted porch a stoa That later became stoicism And in the GrecoRoman world people used stoicism as a comprehensive system for doing many many things But for our purposes chief among them was training yourself to separate what you can control from what you cannot control and then doing exercises to focus exclusively on the former This decreases emotional reactivity which can be a superpower Conversely lets say youre a quarterback You miss a pass You get furious with yourself That could cost you a game If youre a CEO and you fly off the handle at a very valued employee because of a minor infraction that could cost you the employee If youre a college student who say is in a downward spiral and you feel helpless and hopeless unabated that could cost you your life So the stakes are very very high And there are many tools in the toolkit to get you there Im going to focus on one that completely changed my life in 2004 It found me then because of two things a very close friend young guy my age died of pancreatic cancer unexpectedly and then my girlfriend who I thought I was going to marry walked out Shed had enough and she didnt give me a Dear John letter but she did give me this a Dear John plaque Im not making this up Ive kept it Business hours are over at five oclock She gave this to me to put on my desk for personal health because at the time I was working on my first real business I had no idea what I was doing I was working 14plus hour days seven days a week I was using stimulants to get going I was using depressants to wind down and go to sleep It was a disaster I felt completely trapped I bought a book on simplicity to try to find answers And I did find a quote that made a big difference in my life which was We suffer more often in imagination than in reality by Seneca the Younger who was a famous Stoic writer That took me to his letters which took me to the exercise premeditatio malorum which means the premeditation of evils In simple terms this is visualizing the worstcase scenarios in detail that you fear preventing you from taking action so that you can take action to overcome that paralysis My problem was monkey mind  super loud very incessant Just thinking my way through problems doesnt work I needed to capture my thoughts on paper So I created a written exercise that I called fearsetting like goalsetting for myself It consists of three pages Super simple The first page is right here What if I  This is whatever you fear whatever is causing you anxiety whatever youre putting off It could be asking someone out ending a relationship asking for a promotion quitting a job starting a company It could be anything For me it was taking my first vacation in four years and stepping away from my business for a month to go to London where I could stay in a friends room for free to either remove myself as a bottleneck in the business or shut it down In the first column Define youre writing down all of the worst things you can imagine happening if you take that step You want 10 to 20 I wont go through all of them but Ill give you two examples One was Ill go to London itll be rainy Ill get depressed the whole thing will be a huge waste of time Number two Ill miss a letter from the IRS and Ill get audited or raided or shut down or some such And then you go to the Prevent column In that column you write down the answer to What could I do to prevent each of these bullets from happening or at the very least decrease the likelihood even a little bit So for getting depressed in London I could take a portable blue light with me and use it for 15 minutes in the morning I knew that helped stave off depressive episodes For the IRS bit I could change the mailing address on file with the IRS so the paperwork would go to my accountant instead of to my UPS address Easypeasy Then we go to Repair So if the worstcase scenarios happen what could you do to repair the damage even a little bit or who could you ask for help So in the first case London well I could fork over some money fly to Spain get some sun  undo the damage if I got into a funk In the case of missing a letter from the IRS I could call a friend who is a lawyer or ask say a professor of law what they would recommend who I should talk to how had people handled this in the past So one question to keep in mind as youre doing this first page is Has anyone else in the history of time less intelligent or less driven figured this out Chances are the answer is Yes The second page is simple What might be the benefits of an attempt or a partial success You can see were playing up the fears and really taking a conservative look at the upside So if you attempted whatever youre considering might you build confidence develop skills emotionally financially otherwise What might be the benefits of say a base hit Spend 10 to 15 minutes on this Page three This might be the most important so dont skip it The Cost of Inaction Humans are very good at considering what might go wrong if we try something new say ask for a raise What we dont often consider is the atrocious cost of the status quo  not changing anything So you should ask yourself if I avoid this action or decision and actions and decisions like it what might my life look like in say six months 12 months three years Any further out it starts to seem intangible And really get detailed  again emotionally financially physically whatever And when I did this it painted a terrifying picture I was selfmedicating my business was going to implode at any moment at all times if I didnt step away My relationships were fraying or failing And I realized that inaction was no longer an option for me Those are the three pages Thats it Thats fearsetting And after this I realized that on a scale of one to 10 one being minimal impact 10 being maximal impact if I took the trip I was risking a one to three of temporary and reversible pain for an eight to 10 of positive lifechanging impact that could be a semipermanent So I took the trip None of the disasters came to pass There were some hiccups sure I was able to extricate myself from the business I ended up extending that trip for a year and a half around the world and that became the basis for my first book that leads me here today And I can trace all of my biggest wins and all of my biggest disasters averted back to doing fearsetting at least once a quarter Its not a panacea Youll find that some of your fears are very wellfounded But you shouldnt conclude that without first putting them under a microscope And it doesnt make all the hard times the hard choices easy but it can make a lot of them easier Id like to close with a profile of one of my favorite modernday Stoics This is Jerzy Gregorek He is a fourtime world champion in Olympic weightlifting political refugee published poet 62 years old He can still kick my ass and probably most asses in this room Hes an impressive guy I spent a lot of time on his stoa his porch asking life and training advice He was part of the Solidarity in Poland which was a nonviolent movement for social change that was violently suppressed by the government He lost his career as a firefighter Then his mentor a priest was kidnapped tortured killed and thrown into a river He was then threatened He and his wife had to flee Poland bounce from country to country until they landed in the US with next to nothing sleeping on floors He now lives in Woodside California in a very nice place and of the 10000plus people Ive met in my life I would put him in the top 10 in terms of success and happiness And theres a punchline coming so pay attention I sent him a text a few weeks ago asking him Had he ever read any Stoic philosophy And he replied with two pages of text This is very unlike him He is a terse dude And not only was he familiar with stoicism but he pointed out for all of his most important decisions his inflection points when he stood up for his principles and ethics how he had used stoicism and something akin to fearsetting which blew my mind And he closed with two things Number one he couldnt imagine any life more beautiful than that of a Stoic And the last was his mantra which he applies to everything and you can apply to everything Easy choices hard life Hard choices easy life The hard choices  what we most fear doing asking saying  these are very often exactly what we most need to do And the biggest challenges and problems we face will never be solved with comfortable conversations whether its in your own head or with other people So I encourage you to ask yourselves Where in your lives right now might defining your fears be more important than defining your goals Keeping in mind all the while the words of Seneca We suffer more often in imagination than in reality Thank you very muchSo for any of us in this room today lets start out by admitting were lucky We dont live in the world our mothers lived in our grandmothers lived in where career choices for women were so limited And if youre in this room today most of us grew up in a world where we have basic civil rights and amazingly we still live in a world where some women dont have them But all that aside we still have a problem and its a real problem And the problem is this Women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world The numbers tell the story quite clearly 190 heads of state  nine are women Of all the people in parliament in the world 13 percent are women In the corporate sector women at the top Clevel jobs board seats  tops out at 15 16 percent The numbers have not moved since 2002 and are going in the wrong direction And even in the nonprofit world a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women women at the top 20 percent We also have another problem which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment A recent study in the US showed that of married senior managers twothirds of the married men had children and only onethird of the married women had children A couple of years ago I was in New York and I was pitching a deal and I was in one of those fancy New York private equity offices you can picture And Im in the meeting  its about a threehour meeting  and two hours in there needs to be that bio break and everyone stands up and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed And I realized he doesnt know where the womens room is in his office So I start looking around for moving boxes figuring they just moved in but I dont see any And so I said Did you just move into this office And he said No weve been here about a year And I said Are you telling me that I am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year And he looked at me and he said Yeah Or maybe youre the only one who had to go to the bathroom footnote footnote So the question is how are we going to fix this How do we change these numbers at the top How do we make this different I want to start out by saying I talk about this  about keeping women in the workforce  because I really think thats the answer In the highincome part of our workforce in the people who end up at the top  Fortune 500 CEO jobs or the equivalent in other industries  the problem I am convinced is that women are dropping out Now people talk about this a lot and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women I want to talk about none of that today even though thats all really important Today I want to focus on what we can do as individuals What are the messages we need to tell ourselves What are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us What are the messages we tell our daughters Now at the outset I want to be very clear that this speech comes with no judgments I dont have the right answer I dont even have it for myself I left San Francisco where I live on Monday and I was getting on the plane for this conference And my daughter whos three when I dropped her off at preschool did that whole huggingtheleg crying Mommy dont get on the plane thing This is hard I feel guilty sometimes I know no women whether theyre at home or whether theyre in the workforce who dont feel that sometimes So Im not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone footnote footnote My talk today is about what the messages are if you do want to stay in the workforce and I think there are three One sit at the table Two make your partner a real partner And three dont leave before you leave Number one sit at the table Just a couple weeks ago at Facebook we hosted a very senior government official and he came in to meet with senior execs from around Silicon Valley And everyone kind of sat at the table He had these two women who were traveling with him pretty senior in his department and I kind of said to them Sit at the table Come on sit at the table and they sat on the side of the room When I was in college my senior year I took a course called European Intellectual History Dont you love that kind of thing from college I wish I could do that now And I took it with my roommate Carrie who was then a brilliant literary student  and went on to be a brilliant literary scholar  and my brother  smart guy but a waterpoloplaying premed who was a sophomore The three of us take this class together And then Carrie reads all the books in the original Greek and Latin goes to all the lectures I read all the books in English and go to most of the lectures My brother is kind of busy He reads one book of 12 and goes to a couple of lectures marches himself up to our room a couple days before the exam to get himself tutored The three of us go to the exam together and we sit down And we sit there for three hours  and our little blue notebooks  yes Im that old We walk out we look at each other and we say How did you do And Carrie says Boy I feel like I didnt really draw out the main point on the Hegelian dialectic And I say God I really wish I had really connected John Lockes theory of property with the philosophers that follow And my brother says I got the top grade in the class You got the top grade in the class You dont know anything footnote footnote The problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows women systematically underestimate their own abilities If you test men and women and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like GPAs men get it wrong slightly high and women get it wrong slightly low Women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce A study in the last two years of people entering the workforce out of college showed that 57 percent of boys entering or men I guess are negotiating their first salary and only seven percent of women And most importantly men attribute their success to themselves and women attribute it to other external factors If you ask men why they did a good job theyll say Im awesome Obviously Why are you even asking If you ask women why they did a good job what theyll say is someone helped them they got lucky they worked really hard Why does this matter Boy it matters a lot Because no one gets to the corner office by sitting on the side not at the table and no one gets the promotion if they dont think they deserve their success or they dont even understand their own success I wish the answer were easy I wish I could go tell all the young women I work for these fabulous women Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself Own your own success I wish I could tell that to my daughter But its not that simple Because what the data shows above all else is one thing which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women And everyones nodding because we all know this to be true footnote footnote Theres a really good study that shows this really well Theres a famous Harvard Business School study on a woman named Heidi Roizen And shes an operator in a company in Silicon Valley and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture capitalist In 2002  not so long ago  a professor who was then at Columbia University took that case and made it Howard Roizen And he gave the case out both of them to two groups of students He changed exactly one word Heidi to Howard But that one word made a really big difference He then surveyed the students and the good news was the students both men and women thought Heidi and Howard were equally competent and thats good The bad news was that everyone liked Howard Hes a great guy You want to work for him You want to spend the day fishing with him But Heidi Not so sure Shes a little out for herself Shes a little political Youre not sure youd want to work for her This is the complication We have to tell our daughters and our colleagues we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the A to reach for the promotion to sit at the table and we have to do it in a world where for them there are sacrifices they will make for that even though for their brothers there are not The saddest thing about all of this is that its really hard to remember this And Im about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me but I think important I gave this talk at Facebook not so long ago to about 100 employees and a couple hours later there was a young woman who works there sitting outside my little desk and she wanted to talk to me I said okay and she sat down and we talked And she said I learned something today I learned that I need to keep my hand up What do you mean She said Youre giving this talk and you said you would take two more questions I had my hand up with many other people and you took two more questions I put my hand down and I noticed all the women did the same and then you took more questions only from the men And I thought to myself Wow if its me  who cares about this obviously  giving this talk  and during this talk I cant even notice that the mens hands are still raised and the womens hands are still raised how good are we as managers of our companies and our organizations at seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities more than women Weve got to get women to sit at the table footnote footnote Message number two Make your partner a real partner Ive become convinced that weve made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home The data shows this very clearly If a woman and a man work fulltime and have a child the woman does twice the amount of housework the man does and the woman does three times the amount of childcare the man does So shes got three jobs or two jobs and hes got one Who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more The causes of this are really complicated and I dont have time to go into them And I dont think Sunday footballwatching and general laziness is the cause footnote footnote I think the cause is more complicated I think as a society we put more pressure on our boys to succeed than we do on our girls I know men that stay home and work in the home to support wives with careers and its hard When I go to the MommyandMe stuff and I see the father there I notice that the other mommies dont play with him And thats a problem because we have to make it as important a job because its the hardest job in the world to work inside the home for people of both genders if were going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce Studies show that households with equal earning and equal responsibility also have half the divorce rate And if that wasnt good enough motivation for everyone out there they also have more  how shall I say this on this stage They know each other more in the biblical sense as well Message number three Dont leave before you leave I think theres a really deep irony to the fact that actions women are taking  and I see this all the time  with the objective of staying in the workforce actually lead to their eventually leaving Heres what happens Were all busy Everyones busy A womans busy And she starts thinking about having a child and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child she starts thinking about making room for that child How am I going to fit this into everything else Im doing And literally from that moment she doesnt raise her hand anymore she doesnt look for a promotion she doesnt take on the new project she doesnt say Me I want to do that She starts leaning back The problem is that  lets say she got pregnant that day that day  nine months of pregnancy three months of maternity leave six months to catch your breath  Fastforward two years more often  and as Ive seen it  women start thinking about this way earlier  when they get engaged or married when they start thinking about having a child which can take a long time One woman came to see me about this She looked a little young And I said So are you and your husband thinking about having a baby And she said Oh no Im not married She didnt even have a boyfriend I said Youre thinking about this just way too early But the point is that what happens once you start kind of quietly leaning back Everyone whos been through this  and Im here to tell you once you have a child at home your job better be really good to go back because its hard to leave that kid at home Your job needs to be challenging It needs to be rewarding You need to feel like youre making a difference And if two years ago you didnt take a promotion and some guy next to you did if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities youre going to be bored because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal Dont leave before you leave Stay in Keep your foot on the gas pedal until the very day you need to leave to take a break for a child  and then make your decisions Dont make decisions too far in advance particularly ones youre not even conscious youre making footnote footnote My generation really sadly is not going to change the numbers at the top Theyre just not moving We are not going to get to where 50 percent of the population  in my generation there will not be 50 percent of women at the top of any industry But Im hopeful that future generations can I think a world where half of our countries and our companies were run by women would be a better world Its not just because people would know where the womens bathrooms are even though that would be very helpful I think it would be a better world I have two children I have a fiveyearold son and a twoyearold daughter I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home and I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed but to be liked for her accomplishments Thank youSo for any of us in this room today lets start out by admitting were lucky We dont live in the world our mothers lived in our grandmothers lived in where career choices for women were so limited And if youre in this room today most of us grew up in a world where we have basic civil rights and amazingly we still live in a world where some women dont have them But all that

of women And most importantly men attribute their success to themselves and women attribute it to other external factors If you ask men why they did a good job theyll say Im awesome Obviously Why are you even asking If you ask women why they did a good job what theyll say is someone helped them they got lucky they worked really hard Why does this matter Boy it matters a lot Because no one gets to the corner office by sitting on the side not at the table and no one gets the promotion if they dont think they deserve their success or they dont even understand their own success I wish the answer were easy I wish I could go tell all the young women I work for these fabulous women Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself Own your own success I wish I could tell that to my daughter But its not that simple Because what the data shows above all else is one thing which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women And everyones nodding because we all know this to be true footnote footnote Theres a really good study that shows this really well Theres a famous Harvard Business School study on a woman named Heidi Roizen And shes an operator in a company in Silicon Valley and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture capitalist In 2002  not so long ago  a professor who was then at Columbia University took that case and made it Howard Roizen And he gave the case out both of them to two groups of students He changed exactly one word Heidi to Howard But that one word made a really big difference He then surveyed the students and the good news was the students both men and women thought Heidi and Howard were equally competent and thats good The bad news was that everyone liked Howard Hes a great guy You want to work for him You want to spend the day fishing with him But Heidi Not so sure Shes a little out for herself Shes a little political Youre not sure youd want to work for her This is the complication We have to tell our daughters and our colleagues we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the A to reach for the promotion to sit at the table and we have to do it in a world where for them there are sacrifices they will make for that even though for their brothers there are not The saddest thing about all of this is that its really hard to remember this And Im about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me but I think important I gave this talk at Facebook not so long ago to about 100 employees and a couple hours later there was a young woman who works there sitting outside my little desk and she wanted to talk to me I said okay and she sat down and we talked And she said I learned something today I learned that I need to keep my hand up What do you mean She said Youre giving this talk and you said you would take two more questions I had my hand up with many other people and you took two more questions I put my hand down and I noticed all the women did the same and then you took more questions only from the men And I thought to myself Wow if its me  who cares about this obviously  giving this talk  and during this talk I cant even notice that the mens hands are still raised and the womens hands are still raised how good are we as managers of our companies and our organizations at seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities more than women Weve got to get women to sit at the table footnote footnote Message number two Make your partner a real partner Ive become convinced that weve made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home The data shows this very clearly If a woman and a man work fulltime and have a child the woman does twice the amount of housework the man does and the woman does three times the amount of childcare the man does So shes got three jobs or two jobs and hes got one Who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more The causes of this are really complicated and I dont have time to go into them And I dont think Sunday footballwatching and general laziness is the cause footnote footnote I think the cause is more complicated I think as a society we put more pressure on our boys to succeed than we do on our girls I know men that stay home and work in the home to support wives with careers and its hard When I go to the MommyandMe stuff and I see the father there I notice that the other mommies dont play with him And thats a problem because we have to make it as important a job because its the hardest job in the world to work inside the home for people of both genders if were going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce Studies show that households with equal earning and equal responsibility also have half the divorce rate And if that wasnt good enough motivation for everyone out there they also have more  how shall I say this on this stage They know each other more in the biblical sense as well Message number three Dont leave before you leave I think theres a really deep irony to the fact that actions women are taking  and I see this all the time  with the objective of staying in the workforce actually lead to their eventually leaving Heres what happens Were all busy Everyones busy A womans busy And she starts thinking about having a child and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child she starts thinking about making room for that child How am I going to fit this into everything else Im doing And literally from that moment she doesnt raise her hand anymore she doesnt look for a promotion she doesnt take on the new project she doesnt say Me I want to do that She starts leaning back The problem is that  lets say she got pregnant that day that day  nine months of pregnancy three months of maternity leave six months to catch your breath  Fastforward two years more often  and as Ive seen it  women start thinking about this way earlier  when they get engaged or married when they start thinking about having a child which can take a long time One woman came to see me about this She looked a little young And I said So are you and your husband thinking about having a baby And she said Oh no Im not married She didnt even have a boyfriend I said Youre thinking about this just way too early But the point is that what happens once you start kind of quietly leaning back Everyone whos been through this  and Im here to tell you once you have a child at home your job better be really good to go back because its hard to leave that kid at home Your job needs to be challenging It needs to be rewarding You need to feel like youre making a difference And if two years ago you didnt take a promotion and some guy next to you did if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities youre going to be bored because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal Dont leave before you leave Stay in Keep your foot on the gas pedal until the very day you need to leave to take a break for a child  and then make your decisions Dont make decisions too far in advance particularly ones youre not even conscious youre making footnote footnote My generation really sadly is not going to change the numbers at the top Theyre just not moving We are not going to get to where 50 percent of the population  in my generation there will not be 50 percent of women at the top of any industry But Im hopeful that future generations can I think a world where half of our countries and our companies were run by women would be a better world Its not just because people would know where the womens bathrooms are even though that would be very helpful I think it would be a better world I have two children I have a fiveyearold son and a twoyearold daughter I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home and I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed but to be liked for her accomplishments Thank youIn the mid90s the CDC and Kaiser Permanente discovered an exposure that dramatically increased the risk for seven out of 10 of the leading causes of death in the United States In high doses it affects brain development the immune system hormonal systems and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed Folks who are exposed in very high doses have triple the lifetime risk of heart disease and lung cancer and a 20year difference in life expectancy And yet doctors today are not trained in routine screening or treatment Now the exposure Im talking about is not a pesticide or a packaging chemical Its childhood trauma Okay What kind of trauma am I talking about here Im not talking about failing a test or losing a basketball game I am talking about threats that are so severe or pervasive that they literally get under our skin and change our physiology things like abuse or neglect or growing up with a parent who struggles with mental illness or substance dependence Now for a long time I viewed these things in the way I was trained to view them either as a social problem  refer to social services  or as a mental health problem  refer to mental health services And then something happened to make me rethink my entire approach When I finished my residency I wanted to go someplace where I felt really needed someplace where I could make a difference So I came to work for California Pacific Medical Center one of the best private hospitals in Northern California and together we opened a clinic in BayviewHunters Point one of the poorest most underserved neighborhoods in San Francisco Now prior to that point there had been only one pediatrician in all of Bayview to serve more than 10000 children so we hung a shingle and we were able to provide topquality care regardless of ability to pay It was so cool We targeted the typical health disparities access to care immunization rates asthma hospitalization rates and we hit all of our numbers We felt very proud of ourselves But then I started noticing a disturbing trend A lot of kids were being referred to me for ADHD or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder but when I actually did a thorough history and physical what I found was that for most of my patients I couldnt make a diagnosis of ADHD Most of the kids I was seeing had experienced such severe trauma that it felt like something else was going on Somehow I was missing something important Now before I did my residency I did a masters degree in public health and one of the things that they teach you in public health school is that if youre a doctor and you see 100 kids that all drink from the same well and 98 of them develop diarrhea you can go ahead and write that prescription for dose after dose after dose of antibiotics or you can walk over and say What the hell is in this well So I began reading everything that I could get my hands on about how exposure to adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children And then one day my colleague walked into my office and he said Dr Burke have you seen this In his hand was a copy of a research study called the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study That day changed my clinical practice and ultimately my career The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study is something that everybody needs to know about It was done by Dr Vince Felitti at Kaiser and Dr Bob Anda at the CDC and together they asked 17500 adults about their history of exposure to what they called adverse childhood experiences or ACEs Those include physical emotional or sexual abuse physical or emotional neglect parental mental illness substance dependence incarceration parental separation or divorce or domestic violence For every yes you would get a point on your ACE score And then what they did was they correlated these ACE scores against health outcomes What they found was striking Two things Number one ACEs are incredibly common Sixtyseven percent of the population had at least one ACE and 126 percent one in eight had four or more ACEs The second thing that they found was that there was a doseresponse relationship between ACEs and health outcomes the higher your ACE score the worse your health outcomes For a person with an ACE score of four or more their relative risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was two and a half times that of someone with an ACE score of zero For hepatitis it was also two and a half times For depression it was four and a half times For suicidality it was 12 times A person with an ACE score of seven or more had triple the lifetime risk of lung cancer and three and a half times the risk of ischemic heart disease the number one killer in the United States of America Well of course this makes sense Some people looked at this data and they said Come on You have a rough childhood youre more likely to drink and smoke and do all these things that are going to ruin your health This isnt science This is just bad behavior It turns out this is exactly where the science comes in We now understand better than we ever have before how exposure to early adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children It affects areas like the nucleus accumbens the pleasure and reward center of the brain that is implicated in substance dependence It inhibits the prefrontal cortex which is necessary for impulse control and executive function a critical area for learning And on MRI scans we see measurable differences in the amygdala the brains fear response center So there are real neurologic reasons why folks exposed to high doses of adversity are more likely to engage in highrisk behavior and thats important to know But it turns out that even if you dont engage in any highrisk behavior youre still more likely to develop heart disease or cancer The reason for this has to do with the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis the brains and bodys stress response system that governs our fightorflight response How does it work Well imagine youre walking in the forest and you see a bear Immediately your hypothalamus sends a signal to your pituitary which sends a signal to your adrenal gland that says Release stress hormones Adrenaline Cortisol And so your heart starts to pound Your pupils dilate your airways open up and you are ready to either fight that bear or run from the bear And that is wonderful if youre in a forest and theres a bear But the problem is what happens when the bear comes home every night and this system is activated over and over and over again and it goes from being adaptive or lifesaving to maladaptive or healthdamaging Children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation because their brains and bodies are just developing High doses of adversity not only affect brain structure and function they affect the developing immune system developing hormonal systems and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed So for me this information threw my old training out the window because when we understand the mechanism of a disease when we know not only which pathways are disrupted but how then as doctors it is our job to use this science for prevention and treatment Thats what we do So in San Francisco we created the Center for Youth Wellness to prevent screen and heal the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress We started simply with routine screening of every one of our kids at their regular physical because I know that if my patient has an ACE score of 4 shes two and a half times as likely to develop hepatitis or COPD shes four and half times as likely to become depressed and shes 12 times as likely to attempt to take her own life as my patient with zero ACEs I know that when shes in my exam room For our patients who do screen positive we have a multidisciplinary treatment team that works to reduce the dose of adversity and treat symptoms using best practices including home visits care coordination mental health care nutrition holistic interventions and yes medication when necessary But we also educate parents about the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress the same way you would for covering electrical outlets or lead poisoning and we tailor the care of our asthmatics and our diabetics in a way that recognizes that they may need more aggressive treatment given the changes to their hormonal and immune systems So the other thing that happens when you understand this science is that you want to shout it from the rooftops because this isnt just an issue for kids in Bayview I figured the minute that everybody else heard about this it would be routine screening multidisciplinary treatment teams and it would be a race to the most effective clinical treatment protocols Yeah That did not happen And that was a huge learning for me What I had thought of as simply best clinical practice I now understand to be a movement In the words of Dr Robert Block the former President of the American Academy of Pediatrics Adverse childhood experiences are the single greatest unaddressed public health threat facing our nation today And for a lot of people thats a terrifying prospect The scope and scale of the problem seems so large that it feels overwhelming to think about how we might approach it But for me thats actually where the hopes lies because when we have the right framework when we recognize this to be a public health crisis then we can begin to use the right tool kit to come up with solutions From tobacco to lead poisoning to HIVAIDS the United States actually has quite a strong track record with addressing public health problems but replicating those successes with ACEs and toxic stress is going to take determination and commitment and when I look at what our nations response has been so far I wonder why havent we taken this more seriously You know at first I thought that we marginalized the issue because it doesnt apply to us Thats an issue for those kids in those neighborhoods Which is weird because the data doesnt bear that out The original ACEs study was done in a population that was 70 percent Caucasian 70 percent collegeeducated But then the more I talked to folks Im beginning to think that maybe I had it completely backwards If I were to ask how many people in this room grew up with a family member who suffered from mental illness I bet a few hands would go up And then if I were to ask how many folks had a parent who maybe drank too much or who really believed that if you spare the rod you spoil the child I bet a few more hands would go up Even in this room this is an issue that touches many of us and I am beginning to believe that we marginalize the issue because it does apply to us Maybe its easier to see in other zip codes because we dont want to look at it Wed rather be sick Fortunately scientific advances and frankly economic realities make that option less viable every day The science is clear Early adversity dramatically affects health across a lifetime Today we are beginning to understand how to interrupt the progression from early adversity to disease and early death and 30 years from now the child who has a high ACE score and whose behavioral symptoms go unrecognized whose asthma management is not connected and who goes on to develop high blood pressure and early heart disease or cancer will be just as anomalous as a sixmonth mortality from HIVAIDS People will look at that situation and say What the heck happened there This is treatable This is beatable The single most important thing that we need today is the courage to look this problem in the face and say this is real and this is all of us I believe that we are the movement Thank youSo when you think about a child a close friend or a romantic partner the word love probably comes to mind and instantly other emotions rush in joy and hope excitement trust and security and yes sometimes sadness and disappointment There might not be a word in the dictionary that more of us are connected to than love Yet given its central importance in our lives isnt it interesting that were never explicitly taught how to love We build friendships navigate early romantic relationships get married and bring babies home from the hospital with the expectation that well figure it out But the truth is we often harm and disrespect the ones we love It can be subtle things like guilting a friend into spending time with you or sneaking a peak at your partners texts or shaming a child for their lack of effort at school 100 percent of us will be on the receiving end of unhealthy relationship behaviors and 100 percent of us will do unhealthy things Its part of being human In its worst form the harm we inflict on loved ones shows up as abuse and violence and relationship abuse is something that one in three women and one in four men will experience in their lifetime Now if youre like most people when you hear those stats youll go Oh no no no that would never happen to me Its instinctual to move away from the words abuse and violence to think that they happen to someone else somewhere else But the truth is unhealthy relationships and abuse are all around us We just call them different things and ignore the connection Abuse sneaks up on us disguised in unhealthy love I work for an organization called One Love started by a family whose daughter Yeardley was killed by her exboyfriend This was a tragedy no one saw coming but when they looked back they realized the warning signs were there just no one understood what they were seeing Called crazy or drama or too much drinking his actions werent understood to be what they really were which was clear signs of danger Her family realized that if anyone had been educated about these signs her death could have been prevented So today were on a mission to make sure that others have the information that Yeardley and her friends didnt We have three main goals give all of us a language for talking about a subject thats quite awkward and uncomfortable to discuss empower a whole front line namely friends to help and in the process improve all of our ability to love better To do this its always important to start by illuminating the unhealthy signs that we frequently miss and our work really focuses on creating content to start conversations with young people As youd expect most of our content is pretty serious given the subject at hand but today Im going to use one of our more lighthearted yet still thoughtprovoking pieces The Couplets to illuminate five markers of unhealthy love The first is intensity Blue I havent seen you

three minutes Katie Hood Anybody recognize that I dont know I do Abusive relationships dont start out abusive They start out exciting and exhilarating Theres an intensity of affection and emotion a rush It feels really good You feel so lucky like youve hit the jackpot But in unhealthy love these feelings shift over time from exciting to overwhelming and maybe a little bit suffocating You feel it in your gut Maybe its when your new boyfriend or girlfriend says I love you faster than you were ready for or starts showing up everywhere texting and calling a lot Maybe theyre impatient when youre slow to respond even though they know you had other things going on that day Its important to remember that its not how a relationship starts that matters its how it evolves Its important in the early days of a new relationship to pay attention to how youre feeling Are you comfortable with the pace of intimacy Do you feel like you have space and room to breathe Its also really important to start practicing using your voice to talk about your own needs Are your requests respected A second marker is isolation Orange 2 Want to hang out Orange 1 Me and my boyfriend always have Monday Funday

might say things like Why do you hang out with them Theyre such losers about your best friends or They want us to break up Theyre totally against us about your family Isolation is about sowing seeds of doubt about everyone from your prerelationship life Healthy love includes independence two people who love spending time together but who stay connected to the people and activities they cared about before While at first you might spend every waking minute together over time maintaining independence is key You do this by making plans with friends and sticking to them and encouraging your

people or cheating and refusal to listen to you when you tell them they have nothing to worry about and that you only love them Jealousy is a part of any human relationship but extreme jealousy is different Theres a threatening desperate and angry edge to it Love shouldnt feel like this A fourth marker is belittling Blue Wanna hang out Orange I gotta study Blue Youll get an A anyway A for

should be for how theyre treated and to have a language and a voice to use when that bar is not met versus just accepting it For too long weve treated relationships as a soft topic when relationship skills are one of the most important and hard to build things in life Not only can understanding unhealthy signs help you avoid the rabbit hole that leads to unhealthy love but understanding and

have a language and a voice to use when that bar is not met versus just accepting it For too long weve treated relationships as a soft topic when relationship skills are one of the most important and hard to build things in life Not only can understanding unhealthy signs help you avoid the rabbit hole that leads to unhealthy love but understanding and practicing the art of being healthy can improve nearly every aspect of your life Im completely convinced that while love is an instinct and an emotion the ability to love better is a skill we can all build and improve on over time Thank youThe most massive tsunami perfect storm is bearing down upon us This perfect storm is mounting a grim reality increasingly grim reality and we are facing that reality with the full belief that we can solve our problems with technology and thats very understandable Now this perfect storm that we are facing is the result of our rising population rising towards 10 billion people land that is turning to desert and of course climate change Now theres no question about it at all we will only solve the problem of replacing fossil fuels with technology But fossil fuels carbon  coal and gas  are by no means the only thing that is causing climate change Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert and this happens only when we create too much bare ground Theres no other cause And I intend to focus on most of the worlds land that is turning to desert But I have for you a very simple message that offers more hope than you can imagine We have environments where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year On those it is almost impossible to create vast areas of bare ground No matter what you do nature covers it up so quickly And we have environments where we have months of humidity followed by months of dryness and that is where desertification is occurring Fortunately with space technology now we can look at it from space and when we do you can see the proportions fairly well Generally what you see in green is not desertifying and what you see in brown is and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth About two thirds I would guess of the world is desertifying I took this picture in the Tihamah Desert while 25 millimeters  thats an inch of rain  was falling Think of it in terms of drums of water each containing 200 liters Over 1000 drums of water fell on every hectare of that land that day The next day the land looked like this Where had that water gone Some of it ran off as flooding but most of the water that soaked into the soil simply evaporated out again exactly as it does in your garden if you leave the soil uncovered Now because the fate of water and carbon are tied to soil organic matter when we damage soils you give off carbon Carbon goes back to the atmosphere Now youre told over and over repeatedly that desertification is only occurring in arid and semiarid areas of the world and that tall grasslands like this one in high rainfall are of no consequence But if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them you find that most of the soil in that grassland that youve just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae leading to increased runoff and evaporation That is the cancer of desertification that we do not recognize till its terminal form Now we know that desertification is caused by livestock mostly cattle sheep and goats overgrazing the plants leaving the soil bare and giving off methane Almost everybody knows this from nobel laureates to golf caddies or was taught it as I was Now the environments like you see here dusty environments in Africa where I grew up and I loved wildlife and so I grew up hating livestock because of the damage they were doing And then my university education as an ecologist reinforced my beliefs Well I have news for you We were once just as certain that the world was flat We were wrong then and we are wrong again And I want to invite you now to come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery When I was a young man a young biologist in Africa I was involved in setting aside marvelous areas as future national parks Now no sooner — this was in the 1950s — and no sooner did we remove the hunting drumbeating people to protect the animals than the land began to deteriorate as you see in this park that we formed Now no livestock were involved but suspecting that we had too many elephants now I did the research and I proved we had too many and I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain Now that was a terrible decision for me to have to make and it was political dynamite frankly So our government formed a team of experts to evaluate my research They did They agreed with me and over the following years we shot 40000 elephants to try to stop the damage And it got worse not better Loving elephants as I do that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life and I will carry that to my grave One good thing did come out of it It made me absolutely determined to devote my life to finding solutions When I came to the United States I got a shock to find national parks like this one desertifying as badly as anything in Africa And thered been no livestock on this land for over 70 years And I found that American scientists had no explanation for this except that it is arid and natural So I then began looking at all the research plots I could over the whole of the Western United States where cattle had been removed to prove that it would stop desertification but I found the opposite as we see on this research station where this grassland that was green in 1961 by 2002 had changed to that situation And the authors of the position paper on climate change from which I obtained these pictures attribute this change to unknown processes Clearly we have never understood what is causing desertification which has destroyed many civilizations and now threatens us globally We have never understood it Take one square meter of soil and make it bare like this is down here and I promise you you will find it much colder at dawn and much hotter at midday than that same piece of ground if its just covered with litter plant litter You have changed the microclimate Now by the time you are doing that and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground on more than half the worlds land you are changing macroclimate But we have just simply not understood why was it beginning to happen 10000 years ago Why has it accelerated lately We had no understanding of that What we had failed to understand was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world the soil and the vegetation developed with very large numbers of grazing animals and that these grazing animals developed with ferocious packhunting predators Now the main defense against packhunting predators is to get into herds and the larger the herd the safer the individuals Now large herds dung and urinate all over their own food and they have to keep moving and it was that movement that prevented the overgrazing of plants while the periodic trampling ensured good cover of the soil as we see where a herd has passed This picture is a typical seasonal grassland It has just come through four months of rain and its now going into eight months of dry season And watch the change as it goes into this long dry season Now all of that grass you see aboveground has to decay biologically before the next growing season and if it doesnt the grassland and the soil begin to die Now if it does not decay biologically it shifts to oxidation which is a very slow process and this smothers and kills grasses leading to a shift to woody vegetation and bare soil releasing carbon To prevent that we have traditionally used fire But fire also leaves the soil bare releasing carbon and worse than that burning one hectare of grassland gives off more and more damaging pollutants than 6000 cars And we are burning in Africa every single year more than one billion hectares of grasslands and almost nobody is talking about it We justify the burning as scientists because it does remove the dead material and it allows the plants to grow Now looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry what could we do to keep that healthy And bear in mind Im talking of most of the worlds land now Okay We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more without causing desertification and climate change We cannot burn it without causing desertification and climate change What are we going to do There is only one option Ill repeat to you only one option left to climatologists and scientists and that is to do the unthinkable and to use livestock bunched and moving as a proxy for former herds and predators and mimic nature There is no other alternative left to mankind So lets do that So on this bit of grassland well do it but just in the foreground Well impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature and weve done so and look at that All of that grass is now covering the soil as dung urine and litter or mulch as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain to store carbon and to break down methane And we did that without using fire to damage the soil and the plants are free to grow When I first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use muchvilified livestock to address climate change and desertification I was faced with a real dilemma How were we to do it Wed had 10000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists bunching and moving their animals but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world Then wed had 100 years of modern rain science and that had accelerated desertification as we first discovered in Africa and then confirmed in the United States and as you see in this picture of land managed by the federal government Clearly more was needed than bunching and moving the animals and humans over thousands of years had never been able to deal with natures complexity But we biologists and ecologists had never tackled anything as complex as this So rather than reinvent the wheel I began studying other professions to see if anybody had And I found there were planning techniques that I could take and adapt to our biological need and from those I developed what we call holistic management and planned grazing a planning process and that does address all of natures complexity and our social environmental economic complexity Today we have young women like this one teaching villages in Africa how to put their animals together into larger herds plan their grazing to mimic nature and where we have them hold their animals overnight  we run them in a predatorfriendly manner because we have a lot of lands and so on  and where they do this and hold them overnight to prepare the crop fields we are getting very great increases in crop yield as well Lets look at some results This is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe It has just come through four months of very good rains it got that year and its going into the long dry season But as you can see all of that rain almost of all it has evaporated from the soil surface Their river is dry despite the rain just having ended and we have 150000 people on almost permanent food aid Now lets go to our land nearby on the same day with the same rainfall and look at that Our river is flowing and healthy and clean Its fine The production of grass shrubs trees wildlife everything is now more productive and we have virtually no fear of dry years And we did that by increasing the cattle and goats 400 percent planning the grazing to mimic nature and integrate them with all the elephants buffalo giraffe and other animals that we have But before we began our land looked like that This site was bare and eroding for over 30 years regardless of what rain we got Okay Watch the marked tree and see the change as we use livestock to mimic nature This was another site where it had been bare and eroding and at the base of the marked small tree we had lost over 30 centimeters of soil Okay And again watch the change just using livestock to mimic nature And there are fallen trees in there now because the better land is now attracting elephants etc This land in Mexico was in terrible condition and Ive had to mark the hill because the change is so profound I began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the 1970s turn the desert that you see on the right there back to grassland and thankfully now their grandchildren are on the land with hope for the future And look at the amazing change in this one where that gully has completely healed using nothing but livestock mimicking nature and once more we have the third generation of that family on that land with their flag still flying The vast grasslands of Patagonia are turning to desert as you see here The man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher and he has documented the steady decline of that land over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers They put 25000 sheep in one flock really mimicking nature now with planned grazing and they have documented a 50percent increase in the production of the land in the first year We now have in the violent Horn of Africa pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature and openly saying it is the only hope they have of saving their families and saving their culture Ninetyfive percent of that land can only feed people from animals I remind you that I am talking about most of the worlds land here that controls our fate including the most violent region of the world where only animals can feed people from about 95 percent of the land What we are doing globally is causing climate change as much as I believe fossil fuels and maybe more than fossil fuels But worse than that it is causing hunger poverty violence social breakdown and war and as I am talking to you millions of men women and children are suffering and dying And if this continues we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing even after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels I believe Ive shown you how we can work with nature at very low cost to reverse all this We are already doing so on about 15 million hectares on five continents and people who understand far more about carbon than I do calculate that for illustrative purposes if we do what I am showing you here we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere and safely store it in the grassland soils for thousands of years and if we just do that on about half the worlds grasslands that Ive shown you we can take us back to preindustrial levels while feeding people I can think of almost nothing that offers more hope for our planet for your children and their children and all of humanity Thank you Thank you Thank you Chris Chris Anderson Thank you I have and Im sure everyone here has A a hundred questions B wants to hug you Im just going to ask you one quick question When you first start this and you bring in a flock of animals its desert What do they eat How does that part work How do you start Allan Savory Well we have done this for a long time and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed is during mine reclamation where its 100 percent bare But many years ago we took the worst land in Zimbabwe where I offered a £5 note in a hundredmile drive if somebody could find one grass in a hundredmile drive and on that we trebled the stocking rate the number of animals in the first year with no feeding just by the movement mimicking nature and using a sigmoid curve that principle Its a little bit technical to explain here but just that CA Well I would love to  I mean this such an interesting and important idea The best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and  I want to get more on this that we could share along with the talkAS Wonderful CA That is an astonishing talk truly an astonishing talk and I think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way Thank you so muchAS Well thank you Thank you Thank you ChrisIf I should have a daughter instead of Mom shes going to call me Point B because that way she knows that no matter what happens at least she can always find her way to me And Im going to paint solar systems on the backs of her hands so she has to learn the entire universe before she can say Oh I know that like the back of my hand And shes going to learn that this life will hit you hard in the face wait for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the stomach But getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air There is hurt here that cannot be fixed by BandAids or poetry So the first time she realizes that Wonder Woman isnt coming Ill make sure she knows she doesnt have to wear the cape all by herself because no matter how wide you stretch your fingers your hands will always be too small to catch all the pain you want to heal Believe me Ive tried And baby Ill tell her dont keep your nose up in the air like that I know that trick Ive done it a million times Youre just smelling for smoke so you can follow the trail back to a burning house so you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire to see if you can save him Or else find the boy who lit the fire in the first place to see if you can change him But I know she will anyway so instead Ill always keep an extra supply of chocolate and rain boots nearby because there is no heartbreak that chocolate cant fix Okay theres a few that chocolate cant fix But thats what the rain boots are for because rain will wash away everything if you let it I want her to look at the world through the underside of a glassbottom boat to look through a microscope at the galaxies that exist on the pinpoint of a human mind because thats the way my mom taught me That therell be days like this Therell be days like this my momma said When you open your hands to catch and wind up with only blisters and bruises when you step out of the phone booth and try to fly and the very people you want to save are the ones standing on your cape when your boots will fill with rain and youll be up to your knees in disappointment And those are the very days you have all the more reason to say thank you Because theres nothing more beautiful than the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline no matter how many times its sent away You will put the wind in win some lose some You will put the star in starting over and over And no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life And yes on a scale from one to overtrusting I am pretty damn naive But I want her to know that this world is made out of sugar It can crumble so easily but dont be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it Baby Ill tell her remember your momma is a worrier and your poppa is a warrior and you are the girl with small hands and big eyes who never stops asking for more Remember that good things come in threes and so do bad things Always apologize when youve done something wrong but dont you ever apologize for the way your eyes refuse to stop shining Your voice is small but dont ever stop singing And when they finally hand you heartache when they slip war and hatred under your door and offer you handouts on streetcorners of cynicism and defeat you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother Thank you Thank you Thank you Thanks Thank you All right so I want you to take a moment and I want you to think of three things that you know to be true They can be about whatever you want  technology entertainment design your family what you had for breakfast The only rule is dont think too hard Okay ready Go Okay So here are three things I know to be true I know that JeanLuc Godard was right when he said that A good story has a beginning a middle and an end although not necessarily in that order I know that Im incredibly nervous and excited to be up here which is greatly inhibiting my ability to keep it cool And I know that I have been waiting all week to tell this joke Why was the scarecrow invited to TED Because he was out standing in his field Im sorry Okay so these are three things I know to be true But there are plenty of things I have trouble understanding So I write poems to figure things out Sometimes the only way I know how to work through something is by writing a poem Sometimes I get to the end of the poem look back and go Oh thats what this is all about and sometimes I get to the end of the poem and havent solved anything but at least I have a new poem out of it Spokenword poetry is the art of performance poetry I tell people it involves creating poetry that doesnt just want to sit on paper that something about it demands it be heard out loud or witnessed in person When I was a freshman in high school I was a live wire of nervous hormones And I was underdeveloped and overexcitable And despite my fear of ever being looked at for too long I was fascinated by the idea of spokenword poetry I felt that my two secret loves poetry and theater had come together had a baby a baby I needed to get to know So I decided to give it a try My first spokenword poem packed with all the wisdom of a 14yearold was about the injustice of being seen as unfeminine The poem was very indignant and mainly exaggerated but the only spokenword poetry that I had seen up until that point was mainly indignant so I thought thats what was expected of me The first time that I performed the audience of teenagers hooted and hollered their sympathy and when I came off the stage I was shaking I felt this tap on my shoulder and I turned around to see this giant girl in a hoodie sweatshirt emerge from the crowd She was maybe eight feet tall and looked like she could beat me up with one hand but instead she just nodded at me and said Hey I really felt that Thanks And lightning struck I was hooked I discovered this bar on Manhattans Lower East Side that hosted a weekly poetry open Mic and my bewildered but supportive parents took me to soak in every ounce of spoken word that I could I was the youngest by at least a decade but somehow the poets at the Bowery Poetry Club didnt seem bothered by the 14yearold wandering about In fact they welcomed me And it was here listening to these poets share their stories that I learned that spokenword poetry didnt have to be indignant it could be fun or painful or serious or silly The Bowery Poetry Club became my classroom and my home and the poets who performed encouraged me to share my stories as well Never mind the fact that I was 14 They told me Write about being 14 So I did and stood amazed every week when these brilliant grownup poets laughed with me and groaned their sympathy and clapped and told me Hey I really felt that too Now I can divide my spokenword journey into three steps Step one was the moment I said I can I can do this And that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie Step two was the moment I said I will I will continue I love spoken word I will keep coming back week after week And step three began when I realized I didnt have to write indignant poems if thats not what I was There were things that were specific to me and the more that I focused on those things the weirder my poetry got but the more that it felt like mine Its not just the adage Write what you know Its about gathering up all of the knowledge and experience youve collected up to now to help you dive into the things you dont know I use poetry to help me work through what I dont understand but I show up to each new poem with a backpack full of everywhere else that Ive been When I got to university I met a fellow poet who shared my belief in the magic of spokenword poetry And actually Phil Kaye and I coincidentally also share the same last name When I was in high school I had created Project VOICE as a way to encourage my friends to do spoken word with me But Phil and I decided to reinvent Project VOICE this time changing the mission to using spokenword poetry as a way to entertain educate and inspire We stayed fulltime students but in between we traveled performing and teaching nineyearolds to MFA candidates from California to Indiana to India to a public high school just up the street from campus And we saw over and over the way that spokenword poetry cracks open locks But it turns out sometimes poetry can be really scary Turns out sometimes you have to trick teenagers into writing poetry So I came up with lists Everyone can write lists And the first list that I assign is 10 Things I Know to be True And heres what happens you would discover it too if we all started sharing our lists out loud At a certain point you would realize that someone has the exact same thing or one thing very similar to something on your list And then someone else has something the complete opposite of yours Third someone has something youve never even heard of before Fourth someone has something you thought you knew everything about but theyre introducing a new angle of looking at it And I tell people that this is where great stories start from  these four intersections of what youre passionate about and what others might be invested in And most people respond really well to this exercise But one of my students a freshman named Charlotte was not convinced Charlotte was very good at writing lists but she refused to write any poems Miss shed say Im just not interesting I dont have anything interesting to say So I assigned her list after list and one day I assigned the list 10 Things I Should Have Learned by Now Number three on Charlottes list was I should have learned not to crush on guys three times my age I asked her what that meant and she said Miss its kind of a long story And I said Charlotte it sounds pretty interesting to me And so she wrote her first poem a love poem unlike any I had ever heard before And the poem began Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man Did you see him on 60 Minutes racing Michael Phelps in a pool  nothing but swim trunks on  diving in the water determined to beat this swimming champion After the race he tossed his wet cloudwhite hair and said Youre a god No Anderson youre the god Now I know that the number one rule to being cool is to seem unfazed to never admit that anything scares you or impresses you or excites you Somebody once told me its like walking through life like this You protect yourself from all the unexpected miseries or hurt that might show up But I try to walk through life like this And yes that means catching all of those miseries and hurt but it also means that when beautiful amazing things just fall out of the sky Im ready to catch them I use spoken word to help my students rediscover wonder to fight their instincts to be cool and unfazed and instead actively pursue being engaged with what goes on around them so that they can reinterpret and create something from it Its not that I think that spokenword poetry is the ideal art form Im always trying to find the best way to tell each story I write musicals I make short films alongside my poems But I teach spokenword poetry because its accessible Not everyone can read music or owns a camera but everyone can communicate in some way and everyone has stories that the rest of us can learn from Plus spokenword poetry allows for immediate connection Its not uncommon to feel like youre alone or that nobody understands you but spoken word teaches that if you have the ability to express yourself and the courage to present those stories and opinions you could be rewarded with a room full of your peers or your community who will listen And maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie who will connect with what youve shared And that is an amazing realization to have especially when youre 14 Plus now with YouTube that connections not even limited to the room were in Im so lucky that theres this archive of performances that I can share with my students It allows for even more opportunities for them to find a poet or a poem that they connect to Once youve figured this out it is tempting to keep writing the same poem or keep telling the same story over and over once youve figured out that it will gain you applause Its not enough to just teach that you can express yourself You have to grow and explore and take risks and challenge yourself And that is step three infusing the work youre doing with the specific things that make you you even while those things are always changing Because step three never ends But you dont get to start on step three until you take step one first I can I travel a lot while Im teaching and I dont always get to watch all of my students reach their step three but I was very lucky with Charlotte that I got to watch her journey unfold the way it did I watched her realize that by putting the things that she knows to be true into the work shes doing she can create poems that only Charlotte can write about eyeballs and elevators and Dora the Explorer And Im trying to tell stories only I can tell  like this story I spent a lot of time thinking about the best way to tell this story and I wondered if the best way was going to be a PowerPoint a short film  And where exactly was the beginning the middle or the end I wondered whether Id get to the end of this talk and finally have figured it all out or not And I always thought that my beginning was at the Bowery Poetry Club but its possible that it was much earlier In preparing for TED I discovered this diary page in an old journal I think December 54th was probably supposed to be 24th Its clear that when I was a child I definitely walked through life like this I think that we all did I would like to help others rediscover that wonder  to want to engage with it to want to learn to want to share what theyve learned what theyve figured out to be true and what theyre still figuring out So Id like to close with this poem When they bombed Hiroshima the explosion formed a minisupernova so every living animal human or plant that received direct contact with the rays from that sun was instantly turned to ash And what was left of the city soon followed The longlasting damage of nuclear radiation caused an entire city and its population to turn into powder When I was born my mom says I looked around the whole hospital room with a stare that said This Ive done this before She says I have old eyes When my Grandpa Genji died I was only five years old but I took my mom by the hand and told her Dont worry hell come back as a baby And yet for someone whos apparently done this already I still havent figured anything out yet My knees still buckle every time I get on a stage My selfconfidence can be measured out in teaspoons mixed into my poetry and it still always tastes funny in my mouth But in Hiroshima some people were wiped clean away leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page So no matter that I have inhibitions to fill all my pockets I keep trying hoping that one day Ill write a poem I can be proud to let sit in a museum exhibit as the only proof I existed My parents named me Sarah which is a biblical name In the original story God told Sarah she could do something impossible and  she laughed because the first Sarah she didnt know what to do with impossible And me Well neither do I but I see the impossible every day Impossible is trying to connect in this world trying to hold onto others while things are blowing up around you knowing that while youre speaking they arent just waiting for their turn to talk  they hear you They feel exactly what you feel at the same time that you feel it Its what I strive for every time I open my mouth  that impossible connection Theres this piece of wall in Hiroshima that was completely burnt black by the radiation But on the front step a person who was sitting there blocked the rays from hitting the stone The only thing left now is a permanent shadow of positive light After the Abomb specialists said it would take 75 years for the radiationdamaged soil of Hiroshima City to ever grow anything again But that spring there were new buds popping up from the earth When I meet you in that moment Im no longer a part of your future I start quickly becoming part of your past But in that instant I get to share your present And you you get to share mine And that is the greatest present of all So if you tell me I can do the impossible  Ill probably laugh at you I dont know if I can change the world yet because I dont know that much about it  and I dont know that much about reincarnation either but if you make me laugh hard enough sometimes I forget what century Im in This isnt my first time here This isnt my last time here These arent the last words Ill share But just in case Im trying my hardest to get it right this time around Thank youI was a Marine with 11 Weapons Company 81s platoon out in Camp Pendleton California Oorah Audience Oorah I joined a few months after September 11 feeling like I think most people in the country did at the time filled with a sense of patriotism and retribution and the desire to do something  that coupled with that fact that I wasnt doing anything I was 17 just graduated from high school that past summer living in the back room of my parents house paying rent in the small town I was raised in in Northern Indiana called Mishawaka I can spell that later for people who are interested  Mishawaka is many good things but cultural hub of the world it is not so my only exposure to theater and film was limited to the plays I did in high school and Blockbuster Video may she rest in peace I was serious enough about acting that I auditioned for Juilliard when I was a senior in high school didnt get in determined college wasnt for me and applied nowhere else which was a genius move I also did that Hail Mary LA acting odyssey that I always heard stories about of actors moving to LA with like seven dollars and finding work and successful careers I got as far as Amarillo Texas before my car broke down I spent all my money repairing it finally made it to Santa Monica  not even LA  stayed for 48 hours wandering the beach basically got in my car drove home thus ending my acting career so  Seventeen Mishawaka  parents house paying rent selling vacuums  telemarketing cutting grass at the local 4H fairgrounds This was my world going into September 2001 So after the 11th and feeling an overwhelming sense of duty and just being pissed off in general  at myself my parents the government not having confidence not having a respectable job my shitty minifridge that I just drove to California and back  I joined the Marine Corps and loved it I loved being a Marine Its one of the things Im most proud of having done in my life Firing weapons was cool driving and detonating expensive things was great But I found I loved the Marine Corps the most for the thing I was looking for the least when I joined which was the people these weird dudes  a motley crew of characters from a cross section of the United States  that on the surface I had nothing in common with And over time all the political and personal bravado that led me to the military dissolved and for me the Marine Corps became synonymous with my friends And then a few years into my service and months away from deploying to Iraq I dislocated my sternum in a mountainbiking accident and had to be medically separated Those never in the military may find this hard to understand but being told I wasnt getting deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan was very devastating for me I have a very clear image of leaving the base hospital on a stretcher and my entire platoon is waiting outside to see if I was OK And then suddenly I was a civilian again I knew I wanted to give acting another shot because  again this is me  I thought all civilian problems are small compared to the military I mean what can you really bitch about now you know Its hot Someone should turn on the air conditioner This coffee line is too long I was a Marine I knew how to survive Id go to New York and become an actor If things didnt work out Id live in Central Park and dumpsterdive behind Panera Bread I reauditioned for Juilliard and this time I was lucky I got in But I was surprised by how complex the transition was from military to civilian And I was relatively healthy I cant imagine going through that process on top of a mental or physical injury But regardless it was difficult In part because I was in acting school  I couldnt justify going to voice and speech class throwing imaginary balls of energy at the back of the room doing acting exercises where I gave birth to myself  while my friends were serving without me overseas But also because I didnt know how to apply the things I learned in the military to a civilian context I mean that both practically and emotionally Practically I had to get a job And I was an Infantry Marine where youre shooting machine guns and firing mortars Theres not a lot of places you can put those skills in the civilian world Emotionally I struggled to find meaning In the military everything has meaning Everything you do is either steeped in tradition or has a practical purpose You cant smoke in the field because you dont want to give away your position You dont touch your face  you have to maintain a personal level of health and hygiene You face this way when Colors plays out of respect for people who went before you Walk this way talk this way because of this Your uniform is maintained to the inch How diligently you followed those rules spoke volumes about the kind of Marine you were Your rank said something about your history and the respect you had earned In the civilian world theres no rank Here youre just another body and I felt like I constantly had to prove my worth all over again And the respect civilians were giving me while I was in uniform didnt exist when I was out of it There didnt seem to be a  a sense of community whereas in the military I felt this sense of community How often in the civilian world are you put in a lifeordeath situation with your closest friends and they constantly demonstrate that theyre not going to abandon you And meanwhile at acting school  I was really for the first time discovering playwrights and characters and plays that had nothing to do with the military but were somehow describing my military experience in a way that before to me was indescribable And I felt myself becoming less aggressive as I was able to put words to feelings for the first time and realizing what a valuable tool that was And when I was reflecting on my time in the military I wasnt first thinking on the stereotypical drills and discipline and pain of it but rather the small intimate human moments moments of great feeling friends going AWOL because they missed their families friends getting divorced grieving together celebrating together all within the backdrop of the military I saw my friends battling these circumstances and I watched the anxiety it produced in them and me not being able to express our feelings about it The military and theater communities are actually very similar You have a group of people trying to accomplish a mission greater than themselves its not about you You have a role you have to know your role within that team Every team has a leader or director sometimes theyre smart sometimes theyre not Youre forced to be intimate with complete strangers in a short amount of time the selfdiscipline the selfmaintenance I thought how great would it be to create a space that combined these two seemingly dissimilar communities that brought entertainment to a group of people that considering their occupation could handle something a bit more thoughtprovoking than the typical mandatoryfun events that I remember being voluntold to go to in the military  all wellintended but slightly offensive events like Win a Date with a San Diego Chargers Cheerleader where you answer a question about pop culture and if you get it right you win a date which was a chaperoned walk around the parade deck with this already married pregnant cheerleader  Nothing against cheerleaders I love cheerleaders The point is more how great would it be to have theater presented through characters that were accessible without being condescending So we started this nonprofit called Arts in the Armed Forces where we tried to do that tried to join these two seemingly dissimilar communities We pick a play or select monologues from contemporary American plays that are diverse in age and race like a military audience is grab a group of incredible theatertrained actors arm them with incredible material keep production value as minimal as possible  no sets no costumes no lights just reading it  to throw all the emphasis on the language and to show that theater can be created at any setting Its a powerful thing getting in a room with complete strangers and reminding ourselves of our humanity and that selfexpression is just as valuable a tool as a rifle on your shoulder And for an organization like the military that prides itself on having acronyms for acronyms you can get lost in the sauce when it comes to explaining a collective experience And I can think of no better community to arm with a new means of selfexpression than those protecting our country Weve gone all over the United States and the world from Walter Reed in Bethesda Maryland to Camp Pendleton to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait to USAG Bavaria on and offBroadway theaters in New York And for the performing artists we bring its a window into a culture they otherwise would not have had exposure to And for the military its the exact same And in doing this for the past six years Im always reminded that acting is many things Its a craft its a political act its a business its  whatever adjective is most applicable to you But its also a service I didnt get to finish mine so whenever I get to be of service to this ultimate service industry the military for me again  theres not many things better than that Thank you Were going to be doing a piece from Marco Ramirez called I am not Batman An incredible actor and good friend of mine Jesse Perez is going to be reading and Matt Johnson who I just met a couple hours ago Theyre doing it together for the first time so well see how it goes Jesse Perez and Matt Johnson Jesse Perez Its the middle of the night and the sky is glowing like mad radioactive red And if you squint you can maybe see the moon through a thick layer of cigarette smoke and airplane exhaust that covers the whole city like a mosquito net that wont let the angels in And if you look up high enough you can see me standing on the edge of an 87story building And up there a place for gargoyles and broken clock towers that have stayed still and dead for maybe like 100 years up there is me And Im frickin Batman And I gots Batmobiles and batarangs and frickin bat caves like for real And all it takes is a broom closet or a back room or a fire escape and Dannys handmedown jeans are gone And my navy blue polo shirt the one that looks kinda good on me but has that hole on it near the butt from when it got snagged on the chainlink fence behind Arturos but it isnt even a big deal because I tuck that part in and its like all good That blue polo shirt  its gone too And I get like like  transformational And nobody pulls out a belt and whips Batman for talkin back Or for not talkin back And nobody calls Batman simple or stupid or skinny And nobody fires Batmans brother from the Eastern Taxi Company cause they was making cutbacks neither Cause they got nothing but respect And not like afraidrespect just like respectrespect Cause nobodys afraid of you Cause Batman doesnt mean nobody no harm Ever Cause all Batman really wants to do is save people and maybe pay abuelas bills one day and die happy And maybe get like madfamous for real Oh  and kill the Joker Tonight like most nights Im all alone And Im watchin and Im waitin like a eagle or like a  no yeah like a eagle And my cape is flapping in the wind cause its frickin long and my pointy ears are on and that mask that covers like half my face is on too and I got like bulletproof stuff all in my chest so no one can hurt me And nobody  nobody  is gonna come between Batman  and justice From where I am I can hear everything Somewhere in the city theres a old lady picking Styrofoam leftovers up out of a trash can and shes putting a piece of sesame chicken someone spit out into her own mouth And somewhere theres a doctor with a wack haircut in a black lab coat trying to find a cure for the diseases that are gonna make us all extinct for real one day And somewhere theres a man a man in a janitors uniform stumbling home drunk and dizzy after spending half his paycheck on 40ounce bottles of twistoff beer and the other half on a fourhour visit to some ladys house on a street where the lights have all been shot out by people whod rather do what they do in this city in the dark And half a block away from janitor man theres a group of goodfornothings who dont know no better waiting for janitor man with rusted bicycle chains and imitation Louisville Sluggers and if they dont find a cent on him which they wont theyll just pound at him till the muscles in their arms start burning till theres no more teeth to crack out But they dont count on me They dont count on no Dark Knight with a stomach full of grocerystore brand macaroni and cheese and cutup Vienna sausages Cause theyd rather believe I dont exist And from 87 stories up I can hear one of the goodfornothings say Gimme the cash  real fast like that just Gimme me the fuckin cash And I see janitor man mumble something in drunk language and turn pale and from 87 stories up I can hear his stomach trying to hurl its way out his Dickies So I swoop down like madfast and Im like darkness Im like Swoosh And I throw a batarang at the one naked lightbulb And theyre all like Whoa muthafucker Who just turned out the lights Whats that over there What Gimme me what you got old man Did anybody hear that Hear what There aint nothing No really  there aint no bat But then  one out of the three goodfornothings gets it to the head  pow And number two swings blindly into the dark cape before him but before his fist hits anything I grab a trash can lid and  right in the gut And number one comes back with the jump kick but I know judo karate too so Im like  Twice But before I can do any more damage suddenly we all hear a clickclick And suddenly everything gets quiet And the one goodfornothing left standing grips a handgun and aims it straight up like hes holding Jesus hostage like hes threatening maybe to blow a hole in the moon And the goodfornothing who got it to the head who tried to jumpkick me and the other goodfornothing who got it in the gut is both scrambling back away from the dark figure before em And the drunk man the janitor man is huddled in a corner praying to Saint Anthony cause thats the only one he could remember And theres me eyes glowing white cape blowing softly in the wind Bulletproof chest heaving my heart beating right through it in a Morse code for Fuck with me just once come on just try And the one goodfornothing left standing the one with the handgun  yeah he laughs And he lowers his arm And he points it at me and gives the moon a break And he aims it right between my pointy ears like goal posts and hes special teams And janitor man is still calling Saint Anthony but he aint pickin up And for a second it seems like  maybe Im gonna lose Nah Shoot Shoot Fwakaka Dont kill me man Snap Wrist crack Neck Slash Skin meets acid Ahhhhhhh And hes on the floor and Im standing over him and I got the gun in my hands now and I hate guns I hate holding em cause Im Batman And asterisk Batman dont like guns cause his parents got iced by guns a long time ago But for just a second my eyes glow white and I hold this thing for I could speak to the goodfornothing in a language he maybe understands Clickclick And the goodfornothings become goodfordisappearing into whatever toxic waste chemical sludge shithole they crawled out of And its just me and janitor man And I pick him up and I wipe sweat and cheap perfume off his forehead And he begs me not to hurt him and I grab him tight by his janitorman shirt collar and I pull him to my face and hes taller than me but the cape helps so he listens when I look him straight in the eyes And I say two words to him Go home And he does checking behind his shoulder every 10 feet And I swoosh from building to building on his way there cause I know where he lives And I watch his hands tremble as he pulls out his key chain and opens the door to his building And Im back in bed before he even walks in through the front door And I hear him turn on the faucet and pour himself a glass of warm tap water And he puts the glass back in the sink And I hear his footsteps And they get slower as they get to my room And he creaks my door open like madslow And he takes a step in which he never does And hes staring off into nowhere his face the color of sidewalks in summer And I act like Im just waking up and I say Ah whats up Pop And janitor man says nothing to me But I see in the dark I see his arms go limp and his head turns back like towards me And he lifts it for I can see his face for I could see his eyes And his cheeks is drippin but not with sweat And he just stands there breathing like he remembers my eyes glowing white like he remembers my bulletproof chest like he remembers hes my pop And for a long time I dont say nothin And he turns around hand on the doorknob And he aint looking my way but I hear him mumble two words to me Im sorry And I lean over and I open my window just a crack If you look up high enough you could see me And from where I am  I could hear everything Thank youI felt a Funeral in my Brain and Mourners to and fro kept treading  treading  till it seemed that Sense was breaking through  And when they all were seated a Service like a Drum  kept beating  beating  till I thought my Mind was going numb  And then I heard them lift a Box and creak across my Soul with those same Boots of Lead again then Space  began to toll As all the Heavens were a Bell and Being but an Ear and I and Silence some strange Race wrecked solitary here  And then a Plank in Reason broke and I fell down and down  and hit a World at every plunge and Finished knowing  then  We know depression through metaphors Emily Dickinson was able to convey it in language Goya in an image Half the purpose of art is to describe such iconic states As for me I had always thought myself tough one of the people who could survive if Id been sent to a concentration camp In 1991 I had a series of losses My mother died a relationship Id been in ended I moved back to the United States from some years abroad and I got through all of those experiences intact But in 1994 three years later I found myself losing interest in almost everything I didnt want to do any of the things I had previously wanted to do and I didnt know why The opposite of depression is not happiness but vitality And it was vitality that seemed to seep away from me in that moment Everything there was to do seemed like too much work I would come home and I would see the red light flashing on my answering machine and instead of being thrilled to hear from my friends I would think What a lot of people that is to have to call back Or I would decide I should have lunch and then I would think but Id have to get the food out and put it on a plate and cut it up and chew it and swallow it and it felt to me like the Stations of the Cross And one of the things that often gets lost in discussions of depression is that you know its ridiculous You know its ridiculous while youre experiencing it You know that most people manage to listen to their messages and eat lunch and organize themselves to take a shower and go out the front door and that its not a big deal and yet you are nonetheless in its grip and you are unable to figure out any way around it And so I began to feel myself doing less and thinking less and feeling less It was a kind of nullity And then the anxiety set in If you told me that Id have to be depressed for the next month I would say As long I know itll be over in November I can do it But if you said to me You have to have acute anxiety for the next month I would rather slit my wrist than go through it It was the feeling all the time like that feeling you have if youre walking and you slip or trip and the ground is rushing up at you but instead of lasting half a second the way that does it lasted for six months Its a sensation of being afraid all the time but not even knowing what it is that youre afraid of And it was at that point that I began to think that it was just too painful to be alive and that the only reason not to kill oneself was so as not to hurt other people And finally one day I woke up and I thought perhaps Id had a stroke because I lay in bed completely frozen looking at the telephone thinking Something is wrong and I should call for help and I couldnt reach out my arm and pick up the phone and dial And finally after four full hours of my lying and staring at it the phone rang and somehow I managed to pick it up and it was my father and I said Im in serious trouble We need to do something The next day I started with the medications and the therapy And I also started reckoning with this terrible question If Im not the tough person who could have made it through a concentration camp then who am I And if I have to take medication is that medication making me more fully myself or is it making me someone else And how do I feel about it if its making me someone else I had two advantages as I went into the fight The first is that I knew that objectively speaking I had a nice life and that if I could only get well there was something at the other end that was worth living for And the other was that I had access to good treatment But I nonetheless emerged and relapsed and emerged and relapsed and emerged and relapsed and finally understood I would have to be on medication and in therapy forever And I thought But is it a chemical problem or a psychological problem And does it need a chemical cure or a philosophical cure And I couldnt figure out which it was And then I understood that actually we arent advanced enough in either area for it to explain things fully The chemical cure and the psychological cure both have a role to play and I also figured out that depression was something that was braided so deep into us that there was no separating it from our character and personality I want to say that the treatments we have for depression are appalling Theyre not very effective Theyre extremely costly They come with innumerable side effects Theyre a disaster But I am so grateful that I live now and not 50 years ago when there would have been almost nothing to be done I hope that 50 years hence people will hear about my treatments and be appalled that anyone endured such primitive science Depression is the flaw in love If you were married to someone and thought Well if my wife dies Ill find another one it wouldnt be love as we know it Theres no such thing as love without the anticipation of loss and that specter of despair can be the engine of intimacy There are three things people tend to confuse depression grief and sadness Grief is explicitly reactive If you have a loss and you feel incredibly unhappy and then six months later you are still deeply sad but youre functioning a little better its probably grief and it will probably ultimately resolve itself in some measure If you experience a catastrophic loss and you feel terrible and six months later you can barely function at all then its probably a depression that was triggered by the catastrophic circumstances The trajectory tells us a great deal People think of depression as being just sadness Its much much too much sadness much too much grief at far too slight a cause As I set out to understand depression and to interview people who had experienced it I found that there were people who seemed on the surface to have what sounded like relatively mild depression who were nonetheless utterly disabled by it And there were other people who had what sounded as they described it like terribly severe depression who nonetheless had good lives in the interstices between their depressive episodes And I set out to find out what it is that causes some people to be more resilient than other people What are the mechanisms that allow people to survive And I went out and I interviewed person after person who was suffering with depression One of the first people I interviewed described depression as a slower way of being dead and that was a good thing for me to hear early on because it reminded me that that slow way of being dead can lead to actual deadness that this is a serious business Its the leading disability worldwide and people die of it every day One of the people I talked to when I was trying to understand this was a beloved friend who I had known for many years and who had had a psychotic episode in her freshman year of college and then plummeted into a horrific depression She had bipolar illness or manic depression as it was then known And then she did very well for many years on lithium and then eventually she was taken off her lithium to see how she would do without it and she had another psychosis and then plunged into the worst depression that I had ever seen in which she sat in her parents apartment more or less catatonic essentially without moving day after day after day And when I interviewed her about that experience some years later  shes a poet and psychotherapist named Maggie Robbins  when I interviewed her she said I was singing Where Have All The Flowers Gone over and over to occupy my mind I was singing to blot out the things my mind was saying which were You are nothing You are nobody You dont even deserve to live And that was when I really started thinking about killing myself You dont think in depression that youve put on a gray veil and are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood You think that the veil has been taken away the veil of happiness and that now youre seeing truly Its easier to help schizophrenics who perceive that theres something foreign inside of them that needs to be exorcised but its difficult with depressives because we believe we are seeing the truth But the truth lies I became obsessed with that sentence But the truth lies And I discovered as I talked to depressive people that they have many delusional perceptions People will say No one loves me And you say I love you your wife loves you your mother loves you You can answer that one pretty readily at least for most people But people who are depressed will also say No matter what we do were all just going to die in the end Or theyll say There can be no true communion between two human beings Each of us is trapped in his own body To which you have to say Thats true but I think we should focus right now on what to have for breakfast A lot of the time what they are expressing is not illness but insight and one comes to think whats really extraordinary is that most of us know about those existential questions and they dont distract us very much There was a study I particularly liked in which a group of depressed and a group of nondepressed people were asked to play a video game for an hour and at the end of the hour they were asked how many little monsters they thought they had killed The depressive group was usually accurate to within about 10 percent and the nondepressed people guessed between 15 and 20 times as many little monsters  as they had actually killed A lot of people said when I chose to write about my depression that it must be very difficult to be out of that closet to have people know They said Do people talk to you differently I said Yes people talk to me differently They talk to me differently insofar as they start telling me about their experience or their sisters experience or their friends experience Things are different because now I know that depression is the family secret that everyone has I went a few years ago to a conference and on Friday of the threeday conference one of the participants took me aside and she said I suffer from depression and Im a little embarrassed about it but Ive been taking this medication and I just wanted to ask you what you think And so I did my best to give her such advice as I could And then she said You know my husband would never understand this Hes really the kind of guy to whom this wouldnt make any sense so you know its just between us And I said Yes thats fine On Sunday of the same conference her husband took me aside and he said My wife wouldnt think that I was really much of a guy if she knew this but Ive been dealing with this depression and Im taking some medication and I wondered what you think They were hiding the same medication in two different places in the same bedroom And I said that I thought communication within the marriage might be triggering some of their problems But I was also struck by the burdensome nature of such mutual secrecy Depression is so exhausting It takes up so much of your time and energy and silence about it it really does make the depression worse And then I began thinking about all the ways people make themselves better Id started off as a medical conservative I thought there were a few kinds of therapy that worked it was clear what they were  there was medication there were certain psychotherapies there was possibly electroconvulsive treatment and that everything else was nonsense But then I discovered something If you have brain cancer and you say that standing on your head for 20 minutes every morning makes you feel better it may make you feel better but you still have brain cancer and youll still probably die from it But if you say that you have depression and standing on your head for 20 minutes every day makes you feel better then its worked because depression is an illness of how you feel and if you feel better then you are effectively not depressed anymore So I became much more tolerant of the vast world of alternative treatments And I get letters I get hundreds of letters from people writing to tell me about whats worked for them Someone was asking me backstage today about meditation My favorite of the letters that I got was the one that came from a woman who wrote and said that she had tried therapy medication she had tried pretty much everything and she had found a solution and hoped I would tell the world and that was making little things from yarn She sent me some of them And Im not wearing them right now I suggested to her that she also should look up obsessive compulsive disorder in the DSM And yet when I went to look at alternative treatments I also gained perspective on other treatments I went through a tribal exorcism in Senegal that involved a great deal of rams blood and that Im not going to detail right now but a few years afterwards I was in Rwanda working on a different project and I happened to describe my experience to someone and he said Well thats West Africa and were in East Africa and our rituals are in some ways very different but we do have some rituals that have something in common with what youre describing And he said But weve had a lot of trouble with Western mental health workers especially the ones who came right after the genocide I said What kind of trouble did you have And he said Well they would do this bizarre thing They didnt take people out in the sunshine where you begin to feel better They didnt include drumming or music to get peoples blood going They didnt involve the whole community They didnt externalize the depression as an invasive spirit Instead what they did was they took people one at a time into dingy little rooms and had them talk for an hour about bad things that had happened to them He said We had to ask them to leave the country Now at the other end of alternative treatments let me tell you about Frank Russakoff Frank Russakoff had the worst depression perhaps that Ive ever seen in a man He was constantly depressed He was when I met him at a point at which every month he would have electroshock treatment Then he would feel sort of disoriented for a week Then he would feel okay for a week Then he would have a week of going downhill And then he would have another electroshock treatment And he said to me when I met him Its unbearable to go through my weeks this way I cant go on this way and Ive figured out how Im going to end it if I dont get better But he said to me I heard about a protocol at Mass General for a procedure called a cingulotomy which is a brain surgery and I think Im going to give that a try And I remember being amazed at that point to think that someone who clearly had so many bad experiences with so many different treatments still had buried in him somewhere enough optimism to reach out for one more And he had the cingulotomy and it was incredibly successful Hes now a friend of mine He has a lovely wife and two beautiful children He wrote me a letter the Christmas after the surgery and he said My father sent me two presents this year First a motorized CD rack from The Sharper Image that I didnt really need but I knew he was giving it to me to celebrate the fact that Im living on my own and have a job I seem to love And the other present was a photo of my grandmother who committed suicide As I unwrapped it I began to cry and my mother came over and said Are you crying because of the relatives you never knew And I said She had the same disease I have Im crying now as I write to you Its not that Im so sad but I get overwhelmed I think because I could have killed myself but my parents kept me going and so did the doctors and I had the surgery Im alive and grateful We live in the right time even if it doesnt always feel like it I was struck by the fact that depression is broadly perceived to be a modern Western middleclass thing and I went to look at how it operated in a variety of other contexts and one of the things I was most interested in was depression among the indigent And so I went out to try to look at what was being done for poor people with depression And what I discovered is that poor people are mostly not being treated for depression Depression is the result of a genetic vulnerability which is presumably evenly distributed in the population and triggering circumstances which are likely to be more severe for people who are impoverished And yet it turns out that if you have a really lovely life but feel miserable all the time you think Why do I feel like this I must have depression And you set out to find treatment for it But if you have a perfectly awful life and you feel miserable all the time the way you feel is commensurate with your life and it doesnt occur to you to think Maybe this is treatable And so we have an epidemic in this country of depression among impoverished people thats not being picked up and thats not being treated and thats not being addressed and its a tragedy of a grand order And so I found an academic who was doing a research project in slums outside of DC where she picked up women who had come in for other health problems and diagnosed them with depression and then provided six months of the experimental protocol One of them Lolly came in and this is what she said the day she came in She said and she was a woman by the way who had seven children She said I used to have a job but I had to give it up because I couldnt go out of the house I have nothing to say to my children In the morning I cant wait for them to leave and then I climb in bed and pull the covers over my head and three oclock when they come home it just comes so fast She said Ive been taking a lot of Tylenol anything I can take so that I can sleep more My husband has been telling me Im stupid Im ugly I wish I could stop the pain Well she was brought into this experimental protocol and when I interviewed her six months later she had taken a job working in childcare for the US Navy she had left the abusive husband and she said to me My kids are so much happier now She said Theres one room in my new place for the boys and one room for the girls but at night theyre just all up on my bed and were doing homework all together and everything One of them wants to be a preacher one of them wants to be a firefighter and one of the girls says shes going to be a lawyer They dont cry like they used to and they dont fight like they did Thats all I need now is my kids Things keep on changing the way I dress the way I feel the way I act I can go outside not being afraid anymore and I dont think those bad feelings are coming back and if it werent for Dr Miranda and that I would still be at home with the covers pulled over my head if I were still alive at all I asked the Lord to send me an angel and He heard my prayers I was really moved by these experiences and I decided that I wanted to write about them not only in a book I was working on but also in an article and I got a commission from The New York Times Magazine to write about depression among the indigent And I turned in my story and my editor called me and said We really cant publish this And I said Why not And she said It just is too farfetched These people who are sort of at the very bottom rung of society and then they get a few months of treatment and theyre virtually ready to run Morgan Stanley Its just too implausible She said Ive never even heard of anything like it And I said The fact that youve never heard of it is an indication that it is news And you are a news magazine So after a certain amount of negotiation they agreed to it But I think a lot of what they said was connected in some strange way to this distaste that people still have for the idea of treatment the notion that somehow if we went out and treated a lot of people in indigent communities that would be exploitative because we would be changing them There is this false moral imperative that seems to be all around us that treatment of depression the medications and so on are an artifice and that its not natural And I think thats very misguided It would be natural for peoples teeth to fall out but there is nobody militating against toothpaste at least not in my circles People then say But isnt depression part of what people are supposed to experience Didnt we evolve to have depression Isnt it part of your personality To which I would say mood is adaptive Being able to have sadness and fear and joy and pleasure and all of the other moods that we have thats incredibly valuable And major depression is something that happens when that system gets broken Its maladaptive People will come to me and say I think though if I just stick it out for another year I think I can just get through this And I always say to them You may get through it but youll never be 37 again Life is short and thats a whole year youre talking about giving up Think it through Its a strange poverty of the English language and indeed of many other languages that we use this same word depression to describe how a kid feels when it rains on his birthday and to describe how somebody feels the minute before they commit suicide People say to me Well is it continuous with normal sadness And I say in a way its continuous with normal sadness There is a certain amount of continuity but its the same way theres continuity between having an iron fence outside your house that gets a little rust spot that you have to sand off and do a little repainting and what happens if you leave the house for 100 years and it rusts through until its only a pile of orange dust And its that orange dust spot that orange dust problem thats the one were setting out to address So now people say You take these happy pills and do you feel happy And I dont But I dont feel sad about having to eat lunch and I dont feel sad about my answering machine and I dont feel sad about taking a shower I feel more in fact I think because I can feel sadness without nullity I feel sad about professional disappointments about damaged relationships about global warming Those are the things that I feel sad about now And I said to myself well what is the conclusion How did those people who have better lives even with bigger depression manage to get through What is the mechanism of resilience And what I came up with over time was that the people who deny their experience and say I was depressed a long time ago I never want to think about it again Im not going to look at it and Im just going to get on with my life ironically those are the people who are most enslaved by what they have Shutting out the depression strengthens it While you hide from it it grows And the people who do better are the ones who are able to tolerate the fact that they have this condition Those who can tolerate their depression are the ones who achieve resilience So Frank Russakoff said to me If I had a doover I suppose I wouldnt do it this way but in a strange way Im grateful for what Ive experienced Im glad to have been in the hospital 40 times It taught me so much about love and my relationship with my parents and my doctors has been so precious to me and will be always And Maggie Robbins said I used to volunteer in an AIDS clinic and I would just talk and talk and talk and the people I was dealing with werent very responsive and I thought Thats not very friendly or helpful of them And then I realized I realized that they werent going to do more than make those first few minutes of small talk It was simply going to be an occasion where I didnt have AIDS and I wasnt dying but could tolerate the fact that they did and they were Our needs are our greatest assets It turns out Ive learned to give all the things I need Valuing ones depression does not prevent a relapse but it may make the prospect of relapse and even relapse itself easier to tolerate The question is not so much of finding great meaning and deciding your depression has been very meaningful Its of seeking that meaning and thinking when it comes again This will be hellish but I will learn something from it I have learned in my own depression how big an emotion can be how it can be more real than facts and I have found that that experience has allowed me to experience positive emotion in a more intense and more focused way The opposite of depression is not happiness but vitality and these days my life is vital even on the days when Im sad I felt that funeral in my brain and I sat next to the colossus at the edge of the world and I have discovered something inside of myself that I would have to call a soul that I had never formulated until that day 20 years ago when hell came to pay me a surprise visit I think that while I hated being depressed and would hate to be depressed again Ive found a way to love my depression I love it because it has forced me to find and cling to joy I love it because each day I decide sometimes gamely and sometimes against the moments reason to cleave to the reasons for living And that I think is a highly privileged rapture Thank youId like to talk today about the two biggest social trends in the coming century and perhaps in the next 10000 years But I want to start with my work on romantic love because thats my most recent work What I and my colleagues did was put 32 people who were madly in love into a functional MRI brain scanner 17 who were madly in love and their love was accepted and 15 who were madly in love and they had just been dumped And so I want to tell you about that first and then go on into where I think love is going What tis to love Shakespeare said I think our ancestors  I think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago I started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was by looking at the last 45 years of the psychological research and as it turns out theres a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love The first thing that happens is a person begins to take on what I call special meaning As a truck driver once said to me The world had a new center and that center was Mary Anne George Bernard Shaw said it differently Love consists of overestimating the differences between one woman and another And indeed thats what we do And then you just focus on this person You can list what you dont like about them but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do As Chaucer said Love is blind In trying to understand romantic love I decided I would read poetry from all over the world and I just want to give you one very short poem from eighthcentury China because its an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman Its a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot  their car is different from every other car in the parking lot Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party And in this case a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat And it goes like this Its by a guy called Yuan Zhen I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat The night I brought you home I watched you roll it out He became hooked on a sleeping mat probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain just like with you and me But anyway not only does this person take on special meaning you focus your attention on them You aggrandize them But you have intense energy As one Polynesian said I felt like jumping in the sky Youre up all night Youre walking till dawn You feel intense elation when things are going well mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly Real dependence on this person As one businessman in New York said to me Anything she liked I liked Simple Romantic love is very simple You become extremely sexually possessive You know if youre just sleeping with somebody casually you dont really care if theyre sleeping with somebody else But the moment you fall in love you become extremely sexually possessive of them I think theres a Darwinian purpose to this The whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving an intense craving to be with a particular person not just sexually but emotionally It would be nice to go to bed with them but you want them to call you on the telephone to invite you out etc to tell you that they love you The other main characteristic is motivation The motor in the brain begins to crank and you want this person And last but not least it is an obsession Before I put these people in the MRI machine I would ask them all kinds of questions But my most important question was always the same It was What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person And indeed they would say All day All night I can never stop thinking about him or her And then the very last question  I would always have to work myself up to this question because Im not a psychologist I dont work with people in any kind of traumatic situation My final question was always the same I would say Would you die for him or her And indeed these people would say Yes as if I had asked them to pass the salt I was just staggered by it So we scanned their brains looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph with a distraction task in between So we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state And we found activity in a lot of brain regions In fact one of the most important was a brain region that becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine And indeed thats exactly what happens I began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion In fact I had always thought it was a series of emotions from very high to very low But actually its a drive It comes from the motor of the mind the wanting part of the mind the craving part of the mind The kind of part of the mind when youre reaching for that piece of chocolate when you want to win that promotion at work The motor of the brain Its a drive And in fact I think its more powerful than the sex drive You know if you ask somebody to go to bed with you and they say No thank you you certainly dont kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression But certainly around the world people who are rejected in love will kill for it People live for love They kill for love They die for love They have songs poems novels sculptures paintings myths legends In over 175 societies people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system I have come to think its one of the most powerful brain systems on Earth for both great joy and great sorrow And Ive also come to think that its one of three basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction One is the sex drive the craving for sexual gratification WH Auden called it an intolerable neural itch and indeed thats what it is It keeps bothering you a little bit like being hungry The second of these three brain systems is romantic love that elation obsession of early love And the third brain system is attachment that sense of calm and security you can feel for a longterm partner And I think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there looking for a whole range of partners You can feel it when youre just driving along in your car It can be focused on nobody I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time thereby conserving mating time and energy And I think that attachment the third brain system evolved to enable you to tolerate this human being at least long enough to raise a child together as a team So with that preamble I want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends One of the last 10000 years and the other certainly of the last 25 years that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems lust romantic love and deep attachment to a partner The first is women working moving into the workforce Ive looked at 130 societies through the demographic yearbooks of the United Nations Everywhere in the world 129 out of 130 of them women are not only moving into the job market  sometimes very very slowly but they are moving into the job market  and they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women in terms of economic power health and education Its very slow For every trend on this planet theres a countertrend We all know of them but nevertheless  the Arabs say The dogs may bark but the caravan moves on And indeed that caravan is moving on Women are moving back into the job market And I say back into the job market because this is not new For millions of years on the grasslands of Africa women commuted to work to gather their vegetables They came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal The double income family was the standard And women were regarded as just as economically socially and sexually powerful as men In short were really moving forward to the past Then womens worst invention was the plow With the beginning of plow agriculture mens roles became extremely powerful Women lost their ancient jobs as collectors but then with the industrial revolution and the postindustrial revolution theyre moving back into the job market In short they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago 10000 years ago 100000 years ago We are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal And its going to have an impact I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women on the business community Ill say just a couple of things and then go on to sex and love Theres a lot of gender differences anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child I dont know why they want to think that men and women are alike Theres much we have in common but theres a whole lot that we do not have in common We are  in the words of Ted Hughes I think that we are like two feet We need each other to get ahead But we did not evolve to have the same brain And were finding more and more gender differences in the brain Ill only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love One of them is womens verbal ability Women can talk Womens ability to find the right word rapidly basic articulation goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle when estrogen levels peak But even at menstruation theyre better than the average man Women can talk Theyve been doing it for a million years words were womens tools They held that baby in front of their face cajoling it reprimanding it educating it with words And indeed theyre becoming a very powerful force Even in places like India and Japan where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market theyre moving into journalism And I think that the television is like the global campfire We sit around it and it shapes our minds Almost always when Im on TV the producer who calls me who negotiates what were going to say is a woman In fact Solzhenitsyn once said To have a great writer is to have another government Today 54 percent of people who are writers in America are women Its one of many many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market Theyve got incredible people skills negotiating skills Theyre highly imaginative We now know the brain circuitry of imagination of longterm planning They tend to be web thinkers Because the female parts of the brain are better connected they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think put them into more complex patterns see more options and outcomes They tend to be contextual holistic thinkers what I call web thinkers Men tend to  and these are averages  tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous focus on what they do and move in a more stepbystep thinking pattern Theyre both perfectly good ways of thinking We need both of them to get ahead In fact theres many more male geniuses in the world And theres also many more male idiots in the world When the male brain works well it works extremely well And what I really think that were doing is were moving towards a collaborative society a society in which the talents of both men and women are becoming understood and valued and employed But in fact women moving into the job market is having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life Foremost women are starting to express their sexuality Im always astonished when people come to me and say Why is it that men are so adulterous Why do you think more men are adulterous than women Well men are more adulterous And I say Who do you think these men are sleeping with And  basic math Anyway In the Western world women start sooner at sex have more partners express less remorse for the partners that they do marry later have fewer children leave bad marriages in order to get good ones We are seeing the rise of female sexual expression And indeed once again were moving forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands of Africa a million years ago because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today Were also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality Theyre now saying that the 21st century is going to be the century of what they call the symmetrical marriage or the pure marriage or the companionate marriage This is a marriage between equals moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit Were also seeing a rise of romantic love 91 percent of American women and 86 percent of American men would not marry somebody who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner if they were not in love with that person People around the world in a study of 37 societies want to be in love with the person that they marry Indeed arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life I even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great world trend The first one being women moving into the job market the second one being the aging world population Theyre now saying that in America that middle age should be regarded as up to age 85 Because in that highest age category of 76 to 85 as much as 40 percent of people have nothing really wrong with them So were seeing theres a real extension of middle age For one of my books I looked at divorce data in 58 societies And as it turns out the older you get the less likely you are to divorce So the divorce rate right now is stable in America and its actually beginning to decline It may decline some more I would even say that with Viagra estrogen replacement hip replacements and the incredibly interesting women  women have never been as interesting as they are now Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated so interesting so capable And so I honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marriages that time is now However theres always kinds of complications in this These three brain systems  lust romantic love and attachment  dont always go together They can go together by the way Thats why casual sex isnt so casual With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine Dopamines associated with romantic love and you can just fall in love with somebody who youre just having casual sex with With orgasm then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin  those are associated with attachment This is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after youve made love to them But these three brain systems lust romantic love and attachment arent always connected to each other You can feel deep attachment to a longterm partner while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else while you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners In short were capable of loving more than one person at a time In fact you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else Its as if theres a committee meeting going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do So I dont think honestly were an animal that was built to be happy we are an animal that was built to reproduce I think the happiness we find we make And I think however we can make good relationships with each other So I want to conclude with two things I want to conclude with a worry and with a wonderful story The worry is about antidepressants Over 100 million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the United States And these drugs are going generic They are seeping around the world I know one girl whos been on these antidepressants SSRIs serotoninenhancing antidepressants  since she was 13 Shes 23 Shes been on them ever since she was 13 Ive got nothing against people who take them short term when theyre going through something horrible They want to commit suicide or kill somebody else I would recommend it But more and more people in the United States are taking them long term And indeed what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin And by raising levels of serotonin you suppress the dopamine circuit Everybody knows that Dopamine is associated with romantic love Not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit but they kill the sex drive And when you kill the sex drive you kill orgasm And when you kill orgasm you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment The things are connected in the brain And when you tamper with one brain system youre going to tamper with another Im just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place So now  Thank you I want to end with a story And then just a comment Ive been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for 30 years Im an identical twin I am interested in why were all alike Why you and I are alike why the Iraqis and the Japanese and the Australian Aborigines and the people of the Amazon River are all alike And about a year ago an Internet dating service Matchcom came to me and asked me if I would design a new dating site for them I said I dont know anything about personality You know I dont know Do you think youve got the right person They said Yes It got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another Thats my current project it will be my next book Theres all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another Timing is important Proximity is important Mystery is important You fall in love with somebody whos somewhat mysterious in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love You fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your love map an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up And I also think that you gravitate to certain people actually with somewhat complementary brain systems And thats what Im now contributing to this But I want to tell you a story to illustrate Ive been carrying on here about the biology of love I wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it too the magic of it Its a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one  probably a true story It was a graduate student  Im at Rutgers and my two colleagues  Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook Thats where we put our people in the MRI machine And this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student and she was not in love with him And they were all at a conference in Beijing And he knew from our work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody you can drive up the dopamine in the brain and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love So he decided hed put science to work And he invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him And sure enough  Ive never been in one but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks and its crazy and its noisy and its exciting He figured that this would drive up the dopamine and shed fall in love with him So off they go and shes squealing and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time An hour later they get down off of the rickshaw and she throws her hands up and she says Wasnt that wonderful And Wasnt that rickshaw driver handsome Theres magic to love But I will end by saying that millions of years ago we evolved three basic drives the sex drive romantic love and attachment to a longterm partner These circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain Theyre going to survive as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called this mortal coil Thank youWhats the scariest thing youve ever done Or another way to say it is whats the most dangerous thing that youve ever done And why did you do it I know what the most dangerous thing is that Ive ever done because NASA does the math You look back to the first five shuttle launches the odds of a catastrophic event during the first five shuttle launches was one in nine And even when I first flew in the shuttle back in 1995 74 shuttle flight the odds were still now that we look back about one in 38 or so  one in 35 one in 40 Not great odds so its a really interesting day when you wake up at the Kennedy Space Center and youre going to go to space that day because you realize by the end of the day youre either going to be floating effortlessly gloriously in space or youll be dead You go into at the Kennedy Space Center the suitup room the same room that our childhood heroes got dressed in that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin got suited in to go ride the Apollo rocket to the moon And I got my pressure suit built around me and rode down outside in the van heading out to the launchpad  in the Astro van  heading out to the launchpad and as you come around the corner at the Kennedy Space Center its normally predawn and in the distance lit up by the huge xenon lights is your spaceship  the vehicle that is going to take you off the planet The crew is sitting in the Astro van sort of hushed almost holding hands looking at that as it gets bigger and bigger We ride the elevator up and we crawl in on your hands and knees into the spaceship one at a time and you worm your way up into your chair and plunk yourself down on your back And the hatch is closed and suddenly what has been a lifetime of both dreams and denial is becoming real something that I dreamed about in fact that I chose to do when I was nine years old is now suddenly within not too many minutes of actually happening In the astronaut business  the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle its the most complicated flying machine ever built And in the astronaut business we have a saying which is there is no problem so bad that you cant make it worse And so youre very conscious in the cockpit youre thinking about all of the things that you might have to do all the switches and all the wickets you have to go through And as the time gets closer and closer this excitement is building And then about three and a half minutes before launch the huge nozzles on the back like the size of big church bells swing back and forth and the mass of them is such that it sways the whole vehicle like the vehicle is alive underneath you like an elephant getting up off its knees or something And then about 30 seconds before launch the vehicle is completely alive  it is ready to go  the APUs are running the computers are all selfcontained its ready to leave the planet And 15 seconds before launch this happens Voice 12 11 10 nine eight seven six   start two one booster ignition and liftoff of the space shuttle Discovery returning to the space station paving the way  Chris Hadfield It is incredibly powerful to be on board one of these things You are in the grip of something that is vastly more powerful than yourself Its shaking you so hard you cant focus on the instruments in front of you Its like youre in the jaws of some enormous dog and theres a foot in the small of your back pushing you into space accelerating wildly straight up shouldering your way through the air and youre in a very complex place  paying attention watching the vehicle go through each one of its wickets with a steadily increasing smile on your face After two minutes those solid rockets explode off and then you just have the liquid engines the hydrogen and oxygen and its as if youre in a dragster with your foot to the floor and accelerating like youve never accelerated You get lighter and lighter the force gets on us heavier and heavier It feels like someones pouring cement on you or something Until finally after about eight minutes and 40 seconds or so we are finally at exactly the right altitude exactly the right speed the right direction the engine shut off and were weightless And were alive Its an amazing experience But why would we take that risk Why would you do something that dangerous In my case the answer is fairly straightforward I was inspired as a youngster that this was what I wanted to do I watched the first people walk on the moon and to me it was just an obvious thing  I want to somehow turn myself into that But the real question is how do you deal with the danger of it and the fear that comes from it How do you deal with fear versus danger And having the goal in mind thinking about where it might lead directed me to a life of looking at all of the small details to allow this to become possible to be able to launch and go help build a space station where you are on board a millionpound creation thats going around the world at five miles a second eight kilometers a second around the world 16 times a day with experiments on board that are teaching us what the substance of the universe is made of and running 200 experiments inside But maybe even more importantly allowing us to see the world in a way that is impossible through any other means to be able to look down and have  if your jaw could drop it would  the jawdropping gorgeousness of the turning orb like a selfpropelled art gallery of fantastic constantly changing beauty that is the world itself And you see because of the speed a sunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes for half a year And the most magnificent part of all that is to go outside on a spacewalk You are in a oneperson spaceship that is your spacesuit and youre going through space with the world Its an entirely different perspective youre not looking up at the universe you and the Earth are going through the universe together And youre holding on with one hand looking at the world turn beside you Its roaring silently with color and texture as it pours by mesmerizingly next to you And if you can tear your eyes away from that and you look under your arm down at the rest of everything its unfathomable blackness with a texture you feel like you could stick your hand into and you are holding on with one hand one link to the other seven billion people And I was outside on my first spacewalk when my left eye went blind and I didnt know why Suddenly my left eye slammed shut in great pain and I couldnt figure out why my eye wasnt working I was thinking what do I do next I thought well maybe thats why we have two eyes so I kept working But unfortunately without gravity tears dont fall So you just get a bigger and bigger ball of whatever that is mixed with your tears on your eye until eventually the ball becomes so big that the surface tension takes it across the bridge of your nose like a tiny little waterfall and goes goosh into your other eye and now I was completely blind outside the spaceship So whats the scariest thing youve ever done Maybe its spiders A lot of people are afraid of spiders I think you should be afraid of spiders  spiders are creepy and theyve got long hairy legs and spiders like this one the brown recluse  its horrible If a brown recluse bites you you end with one of these horrible big necrotic things on your leg and there might be one right now sitting on the chair behind you in fact And how do you know And so a spider lands on you and you go through this great spasmy attack because spiders are scary But then you could say well is there a brown recluse sitting on the chair beside me or not I dont know Are there brown recluses here So if you actually do the research you find out that in the world there are about 50000 different types of spiders and there are about two dozen that are venomous out of 50000 And if youre in Canada because of the cold winters here in BC theres about 720 730 different types of spiders and theres one  one  that is venomous and its venom isnt even fatal its just kind of like a nasty sting And that spider  not only that but that spider has beautiful markings on it its like Im dangerous I got a big radiation symbol on my back its the black widow So if youre even slightly careful you can avoid running into the one spider  and it lives close the ground youre walking along you are never going to go through a spider web where a black widow bites you Spider webs like this it doesnt build those it builds them down in the corners And its a black widow because the female spider eats the male it doesnt care about you So in fact the next time you walk into a spiderweb you dont need to panic and go with your caveman reaction The danger is entirely different than the fear How do you get around it though How do you change your behavior Well next time you see a spiderweb have a good look make sure its not a black widow spider and then walk into it And then you see another spiderweb and walk into that one Its just a little bit of fluffy stuff Its not a big deal And the spider that may come out is no more threat to you than a lady bug or a butterfly And then I guarantee you if you walk through 100 spiderwebs you will have changed your fundamental human behavior your caveman reaction and you will now be able to walk in the park in the morning and not worry about that spiderweb  or into your grandmas attic or whatever into your own basement And you can apply this to anything If youre outside on a spacewalk and youre blinded your natural reaction would be to panic I think It would make you nervous and worried But we had considered all the venom and we had practiced with a whole variety of different spiderwebs We knew everything there is to know about the spacesuit and we trained underwater thousands of times And we dont just practice things going right we practice things going wrong all the time so that you are constantly walking through those spiderwebs And not just underwater but also in virtual reality labs with the helmet and the gloves so you feel like its realistic So when you finally actually get outside on a spacewalk it feels much different than it would if you just went out first time And even if youre blinded your natural panicky reaction doesnt happen Instead you kind of look around and go Okay I cant see but I can hear I can talk Scott Parazynski is out here with me He could come over and help me We actually practiced incapacitated crew rescue so he could float me like a blimp and stuff me into the airlock if he had to I could find my own way back Its not nearly as big a deal And actually if you keep on crying for a while whatever that gunk was thats in your eye starts to dilute and you can start to see again and Houston if you negotiate with them they will let you then keep working We finished everything on the spacewalk and when we came back inside Jeff got some cotton batting and took the crusty stuff around my eyes and it turned out it was just the antifog sort of a mixture of oil and soap that got in my eye And now we use Johnsons No More Tears which we probably shouldve been using right from the very beginning But the key to that is by looking at the difference between perceived danger and actual danger where is the real risk What is the real thing that you should be afraid of Not just a generic fear of bad things happening You can fundamentally change your reaction to things so that it allows you to go places and see things and do things that otherwise would be completely denied to you  where you could see the hardpan south of the Sahara or you can see New York City in a way that is almost dreamlike or the unconscious gingham of Eastern Europe fields or the Great Lakes as a collection of small puddles You can see the fault lines of San Francisco and the way the water pours out under the bridge just entirely different than any other way that you could have if you had not found a way to conquer your fear You see a beauty that otherwise never would have happened Its time to come home at the end This is our spaceship the Soyuz that little one Three of us climb in and then this spaceship detaches from the station and falls into the atmosphere These two parts here actually melt we jettison them and they burn up in the atmosphere The only part that survives is the little bullet that were riding in and it falls into the atmosphere and in essence you are riding a meteorite home and riding meteorites is scary and it ought to be But instead of riding into the atmosphere just screaming like you would if suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite back to Earth   instead 20 years previously we had started studying Russian and then once you learn Russian then we learned orbital mechanics in Russian and then we learned vehicle control theory and then we got into the simulator and practiced over and over and over again And in fact you can fly this meteorite and steer it and land in about a 15kilometer circle anywhere on the Earth So in fact when our crew was coming back into the atmosphere inside the Soyuz we werent screaming we were laughing it was fun And when the great big parachute opened we knew that if it didnt open theres a second parachute and it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism So we came back we came thundering back to Earth and this is what it looked like to land in a Soyuz in Kazakhstan Reporter And you can see one of those search and recovery helicopters once again that helicopter part of dozen such Russian Mi8 helicopters Touchdown  314 and 48 seconds am Central Time CH And you roll to a stop as if someone threw your spaceship at the ground and it tumbles end over end but youre ready for it youre in a custombuilt seat you know how the shock absorber works And then eventually the Russians reach in drag you out plunk you into a chair and you can now look back at what was an incredible experience You have taken the dreams of that nineyearold boy which were impossible and dauntingly scary dauntingly terrifying and put them into practice and figured out a way to reprogram yourself to change your primal fear so that it allowed you to come back with a set of experiences and a level of inspiration for other people that never could have been possible otherwise Just to finish they asked me to play that guitar I know this song and its really a tribute to the genius of David Bowie himself but its also I think a reflection of the fact that we are not machines exploring the universe we are people and were taking that ability to adapt and that ability to understand and the ability to take our own selfperception into a new place ♫ This is Major Tom to ground control ♫ ♫ Ive left forevermore ♫ ♫

names Jamie Oliver Im 34 years old Im from Essex in England and for the last seven years Ive worked fairly tirelessly to save lives in my own way Im not a doctor Im a chef I dont have expensive equipment or medicine I use information education I profoundly believe that the power of food has a primal place in our homes that binds us to the best bits of life We have an awful awful reality right now America youre at the top of your game This is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world Can I please just see a raise of hands for how many of you have children in this room today Put your hands up You can continue to put your hands up aunties and uncles as well Most of you OK We the adults of the last four generations have blessed our children with the destiny of a shorter lifespan than their own parents Your child will live a life ten years younger than you because of the landscape of food that weve built around them Twothirds of this room today in America are statistically overweight or obese You lot youre all right but well get you eventually dont worry The statistics of bad health are clear very clear We spend our lives being paranoid about death murder homicide you name it its on the front page of every paper CNN Look at homicide at the bottom for Gods sake Right Every single one of those in the red is a dietrelated disease Any doctor any specialist will tell you that Fact dietrelated disease is the biggest killer in the United States right now here today This is a global problem Its a catastrophe Its sweeping the world England is right behind you as usual I know they were close but not that close We need a revolution Mexico Australia Germany India China all have massive problems of obesity and bad health Think about smoking It costs way less than obesity now Obesity costs you Americans 10 percent of your healthcare bills 150 billion dollars a year In 10 years its set to double 300 billion dollars a year Lets be honest guys you havent got that cash I came here to start a food revolution that I so profoundly believe in We need it The time is now Were in a tippingpoint moment Ive been doing this for seven years Ive been trying in America for seven years Now is the time when its ripe  ripe for the picking I went to the eye of the storm I went to West Virginia the most unhealthy state in America Or it was last year Weve got a new one this year but well work on that next season Huntington West Virginia Beautiful town I wanted to put heart and soul and people your public around the statistics that weve become so used to I want to introduce you to some of the people that I care about your public your children I want to show a picture of my friend Brittany Shes 16 years old Shes got six years to live because of the food that shes eaten Shes the third generation of Americans that hasnt grown up within a food environment where theyve been taught to cook at home or in school or her mom or her moms mom She has six years to live Shes eating her liver to death Stacy the Edwards family This is a normal family guys Stacy does her best but shes thirdgeneration as well she was never taught to cook at home or at school The familys obese Justin here 12 years old hes 350 pounds He gets bullied for Gods sake The daughter there Katie shes four years old Shes obese before she even gets to primary school Marissa shes all right shes one of your lot But you know what Her father who was obese died in her arms And then the second most important man in her life her uncle died of obesity and now her stepdad is obese You see the thing is obesity and dietrelated disease doesnt just hurt the people that have it its all of their friends families brothers sisters Pastor Steve an inspirational man one of my early allies in Huntington West Virginia Hes at the sharp knifeedge of this problem He has to bury the people OK And hes fed up with it Hes fed up with burying his friends his family his community Come winter three times as many people die Hes sick of it This is preventable disease Waste of life By the way this is what they get buried in Were not geared up to do this Cant even get them out the door and Im being serious Cant even get them there Forklift OK I see it as a triangle OK This is our landscape of food I need you to understand it Youve probably heard all this before Over the last 30 years whats happened thats ripped the heart out of this country Lets be frank and honest Well modernday life Lets start with the Main Street Fast food has taken over the whole country we know that The big brands are some of the most important powers powerful powers in this country Supermarkets as well Big companies Big companies Thirty years ago most of the food was largely local and largely fresh Now its largely processed and full of all sorts of additives extra ingredients and you know the rest of the story Portion size is obviously a massive massive problem Labeling is a massive problem The labeling in this country is a disgrace The industry wants to selfpolice themselves What in this kind of climate They dont deserve it How can you say something is lowfat when its full of so much sugar Home The biggest problem with the home is that used to be the heart of passing on food culture what made our society That is not happening anymore And you know as we go to work and as life changes and as life always evolves we kind of have to look at it holistically  step back for a moment and readdress the balance It hasnt happened for 30 years OK I want to show you a situation that is very normal right now the Edwards family Jamie Oliver Lets have a talk This stuff goes through you and your familys body every week And I need you to know that this is going to kill your children early How are you feeling Stacy Just feeling really sad and depressed right now But you know I want my kids to succeed in life and this isnt going to get them there But Im killing them JO Yes you are You are But we can stop that Normal Lets get on schools something that Im fairly much a specialist in OK school What is school Who invented it Whats the purpose of school School was always invented to arm us with the tools to make us creative do wonderful things make us earn a living etc etc You know its been kind of in this sort of tight box for a long long time OK But we havent really evolved it to deal with the health catastrophes of America OK School food is something that most kids  31 million a day actually  have twice a day more than often breakfast and lunch 180 days of the year So you could say that school food is quite important really judging the circumstances Before I crack into my rant which Im sure youre waiting for  I need to say one thing and its so important in hopefully the magic that happens and unfolds in the next three months The lunch ladies the lunch cooks of America  I offer myself as their ambassador Im not slagging them off Theyre doing the best they can do Theyre doing their best But theyre doing what theyre told and what theyre being told to do is wrong The system is highly run by accountants theres not enough or any foodknowledgeable people in the business Theres a problem If youre not a food expert and youve got tight budgets and its getting tighter then you cant be creative you cant duck and dive and write different things around things If youre an accountant and a boxticker the only thing you can do in these circumstances is buy cheaper shit Now the reality is the food that your kids get every day is fast food its highly processed theres not enough fresh food in there at all You know the amount of additives E numbers ingredients you wouldnt believe  theres not enough veggies at all French fries are considered a vegetable Pizza for breakfast They dont even get crockery Knives and forks No theyre too dangerous They have scissors in the classroom but knives and forks No And the way I look at it is If you dont have knives and forks in your school youre purely endorsing from a state level fast food because its handheld And yes by the way it is fast food Its sloppy Joes its burgers its wieners its pizzas its all of that stuff Ten percent of what we spend on health care as I said earlier is on obesity and its going to double Were not teaching our kids Theres no statutory right to teach kids about food elementary or secondary school OK We dont teach kids about food right And this is a little clip from an elementary school which is very common in England Who knows what this is Child Potatoes Jamie Oliver Potato So you think these are potatoes Do you know what that is Do you know what that is Child Broccoli JO What about this Our good old friend Child Celery JO No What do you think this is Child Onion JO Onion No JO Immediately you get a really clear sense of Do the kids know anything about where food comes from Who knows what that is Child Uh pear JO What do you think this is Child I dont know JO If the kids dont know what stuff is then they will never eat it JO Normal England and America England and America Guess what fixed that Two onehour sessions Weve got to start teaching our kids about food in schools period I want to tell you about something that kind of epitomizes the trouble that were in guys OK I want to talk about something so basic as milk Every kid has the right to milk at school Your kids will be having milk at school breakfast and lunch right Theyll be having two bottles OK And most kids do But milk aint good enough anymore Dont get me wrong I support milk  but someone at the milk board probably paid a lot of money for some geezer to work out that if you put loads of flavorings colorings and sugar in milk more kids will drink it Yeah Obviously now thats going to catch on the apple board is going to work out that if they make toffee apples theyll eat more as well Do you know what I mean For me there isnt any need to flavor the milk Okay Theres sugar in everything I know the ins and outs of those ingredients Its in everything Even the milk hasnt escaped the kind of modernday problems Theres our milk Theres our carton In that is nearly as much sugar as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop and they are having two a day So let me just show you Weve got one kid here  having you know eight tablespoons of sugar a day You know theres your week Theres your month And Ive taken the liberty of putting in just the five years of elementary school sugar just from milk Now I dont know about you guys but judging the circumstances right any judge in the whole world would look at the statistics and the evidence and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse Thats my belief Now if I came up here and I wish I could come up here today and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer youd be fighting and scrambling to get to me This all this bad news is preventable Thats the good news Its very very preventable So lets just think about we got a problem here we need to reboot Okay so in my world what do we need to do Here is the thing right it cannot just come from one source To reboot and make real tangible change real change so that I could look you in the white of the eyes and say In 10 years time the history of your childrens lives happiness  and lets not forget youre clever if you eat well you know youre going to live longer  all of that stuff it will look different OK So supermarkets Where else do you shop so religiously Week in week out How much money do you spend in your life in a supermarket Love them They just sell us what we want All right They owe us to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket They need to help us shop They need to show us how to cook quick tasty seasonal meals for people that are busy This is not expensive It is done in some and it needs to be done across the board in America soon and quick The big brands you know the food brands need to put food education at the heart of their businesses I know easier said than done Its the future Its the only way Fast food With the fastfood industry you know its very competitive Ive had loads of secret papers and dealings with fast food restaurants I know how they do it I mean basically theyve weaned us on to these hits of sugar salt and fat and x y and z and everyone loves them right So these guys are going to be part of the solution But we need to get the government to work with all of the fast food purveyors and the restaurant industry and over a five six seven year period wean of us off the extreme amounts of fat sugar and all the other nonfood ingredients Now also back to the sort of big brands labeling I said earlier is an absolute farce and has got to be sorted OK school Obviously in schools we owe it to them to make sure those 180 days of the year from that little precious age of four until 18 20 24 whatever they need to be cooked proper fresh food from local growers on site OK There needs to be a new standard of fresh proper food for your children yeah Under the circumstances its profoundly important that every single American child leaves school knowing how to cook 10 recipes that will save their life Life skills That means that they can be students young parents and be able to sort of duck and dive around the basics of cooking no matter what recession hits them next time If you can cook recession money doesnt matter If you can cook time doesnt matter The workplace we havent really talked about it You know its now time for corporate responsibility to really look at what they feed or make available to their staff The staff are the moms and dads of Americas children Marissa her father died in her hand I think shed be quite happy if corporate America could start feeding their staff properly Definitely they shouldnt be left out Lets go back to the home Now look if we do all this stuff and we can its so achievable You can care and be commercial Absolutely But the home needs to start passing on cooking again for sure For sure pass it on as a philosophy And for me its quite romantic but its about if one person teaches three people how to cook something and they teach three of their mates that only has to repeat itself 25 times and thats the whole population of America Romantic yes but most importantly its about trying to get people to realize that every one of your individual efforts makes a difference Weve got to put back whats been lost Huntingtons Kitchen Huntington where I made this program weve got this primetime program that hopefully will inspire people to really get on this change I truly believe that change will happen Huntingtons Kitchen I work with a community I worked in the schools I found local sustainable funding to get every single school in the area from the junk onto the fresh food sixandahalf grand per school Thats all it takes sixandahalf grand per school The Kitchen is 25 grand a month Okay This can do 5000 people a year which is 10 percent of their population and its people on people You know its local cooks teaching local people Its free cooking lessons guys in the Main Street This is real tangible change real tangible change Around America if we just look back now there is plenty of wonderful things going on There is plenty of beautiful things going on There are angels around America doing great things in schools  farmtoschool setups garden setups education  there are amazing people doing this already The problem is they all want to roll out what theyre doing to the next school but theres no cash We need to recognize the experts and the angels quickly identify them and allow them to easily find the resource to keep rolling out what theyre already doing and doing well Businesses of America need to support Mrs Obama to do the things that she wants to do And look I know its weird having an English person standing here before you talking about all this All I can say is I care Im a father and I love this country And I believe truly actually that if change can be made in this country beautiful things will happen around the world If America does it other people will follow Its incredibly important Yeah When I was in Huntington trying to get a few things to work when they werent I thought If I had a magic wand what would I do And I thought You know what Id just love to be put in front of some of the most amazing movers and shakers in America And a month later TED phoned me up and gave me this award Im here So my wish Dyslexic so Im a bit slow My wish is for you to help a strong sustainable movement to educate every child about food to inspire families to cook again and to empower people everywhere to fight obesity Thank youThe Dirty Jobs crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado called Craig Its only a couple dozen square miles Its in the Rockies And the job in question was sheep rancher My role on the show for those of you who havent seen it  its pretty simple Im an apprentice and I work with the people who do the jobs in question And my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what its like to be these people for one day in their life The job in question herding sheep Great We go to Craig and we check into a hotel and I realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute part of this work Normally I never do any research at all But this is a touchy subject and I work for the Discovery Channel and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do And we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals So I call the Humane Society and I say Look Im going to be castrating some lambs Can you tell me the deal And theyre like Yeah its pretty straightforward They use a band basically a rubber band like this only a little smaller This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday  But it had a certain familiarity to it And I said Well what exactly is the process And they said The band is applied to the tail tightly And then another band is applied to the scrotum tightly Blood flow is slowly retarded a week later the parts in question fall off Great  got it OK I call the SPCA to confirm this They confirm it I also call PETA just for fun and they dont like it but they confirm it OK thats basically how you do it So the next day I go out And Im given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built and we go about the business of animal husbandry Melanie is the wife of Albert Albert is the shepherd in question Melanie picks up the lamb one hand on both legs on the right likewise on the left Lamb goes on the post she opens it up Alright Great Albert goes in I follow Albert the crew is around I always watch the process done the first time before I try it Being an apprentice you know you do that Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out you know this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife And Im like Hmm thats not rubber at all you know And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Rockies it was very  It was  it was impressive In the space of about two seconds Albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail right next to the butt of the lamb and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding A second later with a big thumb and a wellcalloused forefinger he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp And he pulled it toward him like so and he took the knife and he put it on the tip Now you think you know whats coming Michael You dont OK He snips it throws the tip over his shoulder and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward and then his head dips down obscuring my view But what I hear is a slurping sound and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and I am not even kidding Can we roll the video No Im kidding we dont  I thought it best to talk in pictures I do something now Ive never ever done on a Dirty Jobs shoot ever I say Time out Stop You guys know the show we use take one we dont do take two Theres no writing theres no scripting theres no nonsense We dont fool around we dont rehearse  we shoot what we get I said Stop This is nuts I mean  This is crazy We cant do this And Alberts like What And Im like I dont know what just happened but there are testicles in this bucket and thats not how we do it He said Well thats how we do it I said Why would you do it this way And before I even let him explain I said I want to do it the right way with the rubber bands And he says Like the Humane Society I said Yes like the Humane Society Lets do something that doesnt make the lamb squeal and bleed Were on in five continents dude Were on twice a day on the Discovery  we cant do this He says OK He goes to his box and pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands Melanie picks up another lamb puts it on the post band goes on the tail band goes on the scrotum Lamb goes on the ground lamb takes two steps falls down gets up shakes a little takes another couple steps falls down Im like this is not a good sign for this lamb at all Gets up walks to the corner Its quivering and it lies down and its in obvious distress And Im looking at the lamb and I say Albert how long When does he get up Hes like A day I said A day How long does it take them to fall off A week Meanwhile the lamb that he had just done his little procedure on is you know hes just prancing around bleeding stopped Hes you know nibbling on some grass frolicking And I was just so blown away at how completely wrong I was in that second And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am so much of the time And I was especially reminded of what a ridiculously short straw I had that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done and there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen And suddenly this whole things starting to feel like a German porno and Im like  Melanie picks up the lamb puts it on the post opens it up Albert hands me the knife I go in tail comes off I go in I grab the scrotum tip comes off Albert instructs Push it way up there I do Push it further I do The testicles emerge They look like thumbs coming right at you And he says Bite em Just bite em off And I heard him I heard all the words  Like how did I get here How did  I mean  how did I get here Its just  its one of those moments where the brain goes off on its own and suddenly Im standing there in the Rockies and all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy You know Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity And Im like What is this jackedup metaphor I dont like what Im thinking right now And I cant get this thought out of my head and I cant get that vision out of my sight so I did what I had to do I went in and I took them I took them like this and I yanked my head back And Im standing there with two testicles on my chin And now I cant get  I cant shake the metaphor Im still in Poetics in Aristotle and Im thinking  out of nowhere two terms come crashing into my head that I hadnt heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there And they are anagnorisis and peripeteia Anagnorisis and peripeteia Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery Literally the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis Its what our network does its what Dirty Jobs is And Im up to my neck in anagnorises every single day Great The other word peripeteia thats the moment in the great tragedies  Euripides and Sophocles Thats the moment where Oedipus has his moment where he suddenly realizes that hot chick hes been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother Thats peripety or peripeteia And this metaphor in my head  Ive got anagnorisis and peripeteia on my chin  Ive got to tell you its such a great device though When you start to look for peripeteia you find it everywhere I mean Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense right Spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people and then  boom  Oh Im dead Peripeteia You know Its crushing when the audience sees it the right way Neo in The Matrix you know Oh Im living in a computer program Thats weird These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations And Ive been having them over 200 dirty jobs I have them all the time but that one  that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasnt prepared for And as I stood there looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled  but it looked OK looking at that poor other little thing that Id done it the right way on and I just was struck by  if Im wrong about that and if Im wrong so often in a literal way what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon Because look  Im not a social anthropologist but I have a friend who is And I talk to him And he says Hey Mike look I dont know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not but do you realize youve shot in every state Youve worked in mining youve worked in fishing youve worked in steel youve worked in every major industry Youve had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years right I can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye dribbling down her chin with the steel workers I mean these are the people that I work with every single day And if you have something to say about their thoughts collectively it might be time to think about it Because dude you know four years So thats in my head testicles are on my chin thoughts are bouncing around And after that shoot Dirty Jobs really didnt change in terms of what the show is but it changed for me personally And now when I talk about the show I no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it I do but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong some of the other notions of work that Ive just been assuming are sacrosanct and theyre not People with dirty jobs are happier than you think As a group theyre the happiest people I know And I dont want to start whistling Look for the Union Label and all that happyworker crap Im just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work Roadkill pickeruppers whistle while they work I swear to God  I did it with them Theyve got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life And I see it over and over and over again So I started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these sacred cows Follow your passion  weve been talking about it here for the last 36 hours Follow your passion  what could possibly be wrong with that Its probably the worst advice I ever got Follow your dreams and go broke right I mean thats all I heard growing up I didnt know what to do with my life but I was told if you follow your passion its going to work out I can give you 30 examples right now Bob Combs the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them to his swine Why Because theres so much protein in the stuff we dont eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed and hes one rich pig farmer Hes good for the environment he spends his days doing this incredible service and he smells like hell but God bless him Hes making a great living You ask him Did you follow your passion here and hed laugh at you The guys worth  he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm and turned it down outside of Vegas He didnt follow his passion He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way And I hear that story over and over Matt Freund a dairy farmer in New Canaan Connecticut who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk if he could use it to make these biodegradable flowerpots Now hes selling them to Walmart right Follow his passion The guys  come on So I started to look at passion I started to look at efficiency vs effectiveness As Tim talked about earlier thats a huge distinction I started to look at teamwork and determination And basically all those platitudes they call successories that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now that stuff  its suddenly all been turned on its head Safety Safety first is  Going back to OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society What if OSHA got it wrong I mean  this is heresy what Im about to say  but what if its really safety third Right No I mean really What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that Im working with but the ones who really get it done  theyre not out there talking about safety first They know that other things come first  the business of doing the work comes first the business of getting it done And Ill never forget up in the Bering Sea I was on a crab boat with the Deadliest Catch guys  which I also work on in the first season We were about 100 miles off the coast of Russia 50foot seas big waves green water coming over the wheelhouse right Most hazardous environment Id ever seen and I was back with a guy lashing the pots down So Im 40 feet off the deck which is like looking down at the top of your shoe you know and its doing this in the ocean Unspeakably dangerous I scamper down I go into the wheelhouse and I say with some level of incredulity Captain  OSHA And he says OSHA Ocean And he points out there But in that moment what he said next cant be repeated in the Lower 48 It cant be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site But he looked at me and said Son  hes my age by the way he calls me son I love that  he says Son Im the captain of a crab boat My responsibility is not to get you home alive My responsibility is to get you home rich You want to get home alive thats on you And for the rest of that day  safety first I mean I was like  So the idea that we create this sense of complacency when all we do is talk about somebody elses responsibility as though its our own and vice versa Anyhow a whole lot of things I could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that I got it wrong But what it all comes down to is this Ive formed a theory and Im going to share it now in my remaining 2 minutes and 30 seconds It goes like this weve declared war on work as a society  all of us Its a civil war Its a cold war really We didnt set out to do it and we didnt twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way but weve done it And weve waged this war on at least four fronts certainly in Hollywood The way we portray working people on TV  its laughable If theres a plumber hes 300 pounds and hes got a giant butt crack admit it You see him all the time Thats what plumbers look like right We turn them into heroes or we turn them into punch lines Thats what TV does We try hard on Dirty Jobs not to do that which is why I do the work and I dont cheat But weve waged this war on Madison Avenue So many of the commercials that come out there in the way of a message  whats really being said Your life would be better if you could work a little less didnt have to work so hard got home a little earlier could retire a little faster punch out a little sooner Its all in there over and over again and again Washington I cant even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect the bottomline reality of the available jobs because I dont really know I just know that thats a front in this war And right here guys  Silicon Valley I mean  how many people have an iPhone on them right now How many people have their BlackBerry Were plugged in were connected I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution Good grief not to this crowd But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time And nobody celebrates imitation the way Dirty Jobs guys know it has to be done Your iPhone without those people making the same interface the same circuitry the same board over and over  all of that  thats what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it So weve got this new toolbox You know Our tools today dont look like shovels and picks They look like the stuff we walk around with And so the collective effect of all of that has been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs And I realized probably too late in this game  I hope not because I dont know if I can do 200 more of these things  but were going to do as many as we can And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things not just the testicles on my chin I got a lot wrong So were thinking  by we I mean me  that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work  manual labor skilled labor Somebody needs to be out there talking about the forgotten benefits Im talking about grandfather stuff the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but weve kind of  you know kind of lost a little Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs The infrastructure is a huge deal This war on work that I suppose exists has casualties like any other war The infrastructure is the first one declining trade school enrollments are the second one Every single year fewer electricians fewer carpenters fewer plumbers fewer welders fewer pipe fitters fewer steam fitters The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating are those guys  the ones that have been in decline over and over Meanwhile weve got two trillion dollars at a minimum according to the American Society of Civil Engineers that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure which is currently rated at a D minus So if I were running for anything  and Im not  I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make and the jobs we hope to create arent going to stick unless theyre jobs that people want And I know the point of this conference is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us but I also know that clean and dirty arent opposites Theyre two sides of the same coin just like innovation and imitation like risk and responsibility like peripeteia and anagnorisis like that poor little lamb who I hope isnt quivering anymore and like my time thats gone Its been great talking to you And get back to work will youWe see with the eyes but we see with the brain as well And seeing with the brain is often called imagination And we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination our inscapes Weve lived with them all our lives But there are also hallucinations as well And hallucinations are completely different They dont seem to be of our creation They dont seem to be under control They seem to come from the outside and to mimic perception So I am going to be talking about hallucinations and a particular sort of visual hallucination which I see among my patients A few months ago I got a phone call from a nursing home where I work They told me that one of their residents an old lady in her 90s was seeing things and they wondered if shed gone bonkers or because she was an old lady whether shed had a stroke or whether she had Alzheimers And so they asked me if I would come and see Rosalie the old lady I went in to see her It was evident straightaway that she was perfectly sane and lucid and of good intelligence but shed been very startled and very bewildered because shed been seeing things And she told me  the nurses hadnt mentioned this  that she was blind that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years But now for the last few days shed been seeing things So I said What sort of things And she said People in Eastern dress in drapes walking up and down stairs A man who turns towards me and smiles but he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth Animals too I see a white building Its snowing a soft snow I see this horse with a harness dragging the snow away Then one night the scene changes I see cats and dogs walking towards me They come to a certain point and then stop Then it changes again I see a lot of children Theyre walking up and down stairs They wear bright colors rose and blue like Eastern dress Sometimes she said before the people come on she may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor which seem to go up to the ceiling I said Is this like a dream And she said No its not like a dream Its like a movie She said Its got color Its got motion But its completely silent like a silent movie And she said its a rather boring movie She said All these people with Eastern dress walking up and down very repetitive very limited And she had a sense of humor She knew it was a hallucination but she was frightened She had lived 95 years and shed never had a hallucination before She said that the hallucinations were unrelated to anything she was thinking or feeling or doing that they seemed to come on by themselves or disappear She had no control over them She said she didnt recognize any of the people or places in the hallucinations and none of the people or the animals  well they all seemed oblivious of her And she didnt know what was going on She wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind Well I examined her carefully She was a bright old lady perfectly sane She had no medical problems She wasnt on any medications which could produce hallucinations But she was blind And I then said to her I think I know what you have I said There is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness This was originally described I said right back in the 18th century by a man called Charles Bonnet And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome Theres nothing wrong with your brain Theres nothing wrong with your mind You have Charles Bonnet syndrome And she was very relieved at this that there was nothing seriously the matter and also rather curious She said Who is this Charles Bonnet She said Did he have them himself And she said Tell all the nurses that I have Charles Bonnet syndrome Im not crazy Im not demented I have Charles Bonnet syndrome Well so I did tell the nurses Now this for me is a common situation I work in oldage homes largely I see a lot of elderly people who are hearingimpaired or visually impaired About 10 percent of the hearingimpaired people get musical hallucinations And about 10 percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations You dont have to be completely blind only sufficiently impaired Now with the original description in the 18th century Charles Bonnet did not have them His grandfather had these hallucinations His grandfather was a magistrate an elderly man Hed had cataract surgery His vision was pretty poor And in 1759 he described to his grandson various things he was seeing The first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair It was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles And he knew it was a hallucination You dont have handkerchiefs in midair And then he saw a big wheel in midair But sometimes he wasnt sure whether he was hallucinating or not because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions So on one occasion when his granddaughters were visiting them he said And who are these handsome young men with you And they said Alas Grandpapa there are no handsome young men And then the handsome young men disappeared Its typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash They dont usually fade in and out They are rather sudden and they change suddenly Charles Lullin the grandfather saw hundreds of different figures different landscapes of all sorts On one occasion he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe and realized it was himself That was the only figure he recognized On one occasion when he was walking in the streets of Paris he saw  this was real  a scaffolding But when he got back home he saw a miniature of the scaffolding six inches high on his study table This repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia With him and with Rosalie what seems to be going on  and Rosalie said Whats going on  and I said that as you lose vision as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input they become hyperactive and excitable and they start to fire spontaneously And you start to see things The things you see can be very complicated indeed With another patient of mine who also had some vision the visions she had could be disturbing On one occasion she said she saw a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant And he turned round and then he divided into six figures in striped shirts who started walking towards her And then the six figures came together like a concertina Once when she was driving or rather her husband was driving the road divided into four and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads She had very mobile hallucinations as well A lot of them had to do with a car Sometimes she would see a teenage boy sitting on the hood of the car He was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully when the car turned And then when they came to a stop the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff 100 foot in the air and then disappear Another patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination This was a woman who didnt have trouble with her eyes but the visual parts of her brain a little tumor in the occipital cortex And above all she would see cartoons And these cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field like a screen And especially she saw cartoons of Kermit the Frog Now I dont watch Sesame Street but she made a point of saying Why Kermit she said Kermit the Frog means nothing to me You know I was wondering about Freudian determinants Why Kermit Kermit the Frog means nothing to me She didnt mind the cartoons too much But what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with Rosalie the faces were often deformed with very large teeth or very large eyes And these frightened her Well what is going on with these people As a physician I have to try and define whats going on and to reassure people especially to reassure them that theyre not going insane Something like 10 percent as I said of visually impaired people get these But no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something And if they do mention them to their own doctors they may be misdiagnosed In particular the notion is that if you see things or hear things youre going mad But the psychotic hallucinations are quite different Psychotic hallucinations whether they are visual or vocal they address you They accuse you they seduce you they humiliate you they jeer at you You interact with them There is none of this quality of being addressed with these Charles Bonnet hallucinations There is a film Youre seeing a film which has nothing to do with you  or thats how people think about it There is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy and sometimes if one has this one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place in the past Youre at a particular road junction You smell chestnuts roasting You hear the traffic All the senses are involved And youre waiting for your girl And its that Tuesday evening back in 1982 The temporal lobe hallucinations are all sense hallucinations full of feeling full of familiarity located in space and time coherent dramatic The Charles Bonnet ones are quite different In the Charles Bonnet hallucinations you have all sorts of levels from the geometrical hallucinations  the pink and blue squares the woman had  up to quite elaborate hallucinations with figures and especially faces Faces and sometimes deformed faces are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations And one of the second commonest is cartoons So what is going on Fascinatingly in the last few years its been possible to do functional brain imagery to do fMRI on people as they are hallucinating and in fact to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated as they are hallucinating When people have these simple geometrical hallucinations the primary visual cortex is activated This is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns You dont form images with your primary visual cortex When images are formed a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe And in particular one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus And its known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus they may lose the ability to recognize faces But if theres an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus they may hallucinate faces and this is exactly what you find in some of these people There is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations There is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons Its activated when one recognizes cartoons when one draws cartoons and when one hallucinates them Its very interesting that that should be specific There are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved with the recognition and hallucination of buildings and landscapes Around 1970 it was found that there were not only parts of the brain but particular cells Face cells were discovered around 1970 And now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells which can be very very specific So you may not only have car cells you may have Aston Martin cells I saw an Aston Martin this morning I had to bring it in And now its in there somewhere So  now at this level in whats called the inferotemporal cortex there are only visual images or figments or fragments Its only at higher levels that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome you dont go to those higher levels Youre in these levels of inferior visual cortex where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images or figments or fragmentary figments all neurally encoded in particular cells or small clusters of cells Normally these are all part of the integrated stream of perception or imagination and one is not conscious of them It is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted And instead of getting normal perception youre getting an anarchic convulsive stimulation or release of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex So suddenly you see a face Suddenly you see a car Suddenly this and suddenly that The mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this but not terribly successfully When these were first described it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams But in fact people say I dont recognize the people I cant form any associations Kermit means nothing to me You dont get anywhere thinking of them as dreams Well Ive more or less said what I wanted I think I just want to recapitulate and say this is common Think of the number of blind people There must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations but are too scared to mention them So this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice for patients for doctors for the public Finally I think they are infinitely interesting and valuable for giving one some insight as to how the brain works Charles Bonnet said 250 years ago  he wondered how thinking of these hallucinations how as he put it the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain Now 250 years later I think were beginning to glimpse how this is done Thanks very much Chris Anderson That was superb Thank you so much You speak about these things with so much insight and empathy for your patients Have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about Oliver Sacks I was afraid you would ask that Well yeah a lot of them And actually Im a little visually impaired myself Im blind in one eye and not terribly good in the other And I see the geometrical hallucinations But they stop there CA And they dont disturb you Because you understand whats doing it it doesnt make you worried OS Well they dont disturb me any more than my tinnitus which I ignore They occasionally interest me and I have many pictures of them in my notebooks Ive gone and had an fMRI myself to see how my visual cortex is ticking over And when I see all these hexagons and complex things which I also have in visual migraine I wonder whether everyone sees things like this and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit CA That was an utterly utterly fascinating talk Thank you so much for sharing OS Thank you Thank youThank you very much I moved to America 12 years ago with my wife Terry and our two kids Actually truthfully we moved to Los Angeles  thinking we were moving to America but anyway  Its a short plane ride from Los Angeles to America I got here 12 years ago and when I got here I was told various things like Americans dont get irony Have you come across this idea Its not true Ive traveled the whole length and breadth of this country I have found no evidence that Americans dont get irony Its one of those cultural myths like The British are reserved I dont know why people think this Weve invaded every country weve encountered But its not true Americans dont get irony but I just want you to know that thats what people are saying about you behind your back You know so when you leave living rooms in Europe people say thankfully nobody was ironic in your presence But I knew that Americans get irony when I came across that legislation No Child Left Behind Because whoever thought of that title gets irony Dont they Because its leaving millions of children behind Now I can see thats not a very attractive name for legislation Millions of Children Left Behind I can see that Whats the plan We propose to leave millions of children behind and heres how its going to work And its working beautifully In some parts of the country 60 percent of kids drop out of high school In the Native American communities its 80 percent of kids If we halved that number one estimate is it would create a net gain to the US economy over 10 years of nearly a trillion dollars From an economic point of view this is good math isnt it that we should do this It actually costs an enormous amount to mop up the damage from the dropout crisis But the dropout crisis is just the tip of an iceberg What it doesnt count are all the kids who are in school but being disengaged from it who dont enjoy it who dont get any real benefit from it And the reason is not that were not spending enough money America spends more money on education than most other countries Class sizes are smaller than in many countries And there are hundreds of initiatives every year to try and improve education The trouble is its all going in the wrong direction There are three principles on which human life flourishes and they are contradicted by the culture of education under which most teachers have to labor and most students have to endure The first is this that human beings are naturally different and diverse Can I ask you how many of you have got children of your own Okay Or grandchildren How about two children or more Right And the rest of you have seen such children Small people wandering about I will make you a bet and I am confident that I will win the bet If youve got two children or more I bet you they are completely different from each other Arent they You would never confuse them would you Like Which one are you Remind me Your mother and I need some colorcoding system so we dont get confused Education under No Child Left Behind is based on not diversity but conformity What schools are encouraged to do is to find out what kids can do across a very narrow spectrum of achievement One of the effects of No Child Left Behind has been to narrow the focus onto the socalled STEM disciplines Theyre very important Im not here to argue against science and math On the contrary theyre necessary but theyre not sufficient A real education has to give equal weight to the arts the humanities to physical education An awful lot of kids sorry thank you  One estimate in America currently is that something like 10 percent of kids getting on that way are being diagnosed with various conditions under the broad title of attention deficit disorder ADHD Im not saying theres no such thing I just dont believe its an epidemic like this If you sit kids down hour after hour doing lowgrade clerical work dont be surprised if they start to fidget you know Children are not for the most part suffering from a psychological condition Theyre suffering from childhood And I know this because I spent my early life as a child I went through the whole thing Kids prosper best with a broad curriculum that celebrates their various talents not just a small range of them And by the way the arts arent just important because they improve math scores Theyre important because they speak to parts of childrens being which are otherwise untouched The second thank you  The second principle that drives human life flourishing is curiosity If you can light the spark of curiosity in a child they will learn without any further assistance very often Children are natural learners Its a real achievement to put that particular ability out or to stifle it Curiosity is the engine of achievement Now the reason I say this is because one of the effects of the current culture here if I can say so has been to deprofessionalize teachers There is no system in the world or any school in the country that is better than its teachers Teachers are the lifeblood of the success of schools But teaching is a creative profession Teaching properly conceived is not a delivery system You know youre not there just to pass on received information Great teachers do that but what great teachers also do is mentor stimulate provoke engage You see in the end education is about learning If theres no learning going on theres no education going on And people can spend an awful lot of time discussing education without ever discussing learning The whole point of education is to get people to learn An old friend of mine  actually very old hes dead Thats as old as it gets Im afraid But a wonderful guy he was wonderful philosopher He used to talk about the difference between the task and achievement senses of verbs You can be engaged in the activity of something but not really be achieving it like dieting Its a very good example There he is Hes dieting Is he losing any weight Not really Teaching is a word like that You can say Theres Deborah shes in room 34 shes teaching But if nobodys learning anything she may be engaged in the task of teaching but not actually fulfilling it The role of a teacher is to facilitate learning Thats it And part of the problem is I think that the dominant culture of education has come to focus on not teaching and learning but testing Now testing is important Standardized tests have a place But they should not be the dominant culture of education They should be diagnostic They should help If I go for a medical examination I want some standardized tests I do I want to know what my cholesterol level is compared to everybody elses on a standard scale I dont want to be told on some scale my doctor invented in the car Your cholesterol is what I call Level Orange Really Is that good We dont know But all that should support learning It shouldnt obstruct it which of course it often does So in place of curiosity what we have is a culture of compliance Our children and teachers are encouraged to follow routine algorithms rather than to excite that power of imagination and curiosity And the third principle is this that human life is inherently creative Its why we all have different résumés We create our lives and we can recreate them as we go through them Its the common currency of being a human being Its why human culture is so interesting and diverse and dynamic I mean other animals may well have imaginations and creativity but its not so much in evidence is it as ours I mean you may have a dog And your dog may get depressed You know but it doesnt listen to Radiohead does it And sit staring out the window with a bottle of Jack Daniels Would you like to come for a walk No Im fine You go Ill wait But take pictures We all create our own lives through this restless process of imagining alternatives and possibilities and one of the roles of education is to awaken and develop these powers of creativity Instead what we have is a culture of standardization Now it doesnt have to be that way It really doesnt Finland regularly comes out on top in math science and reading Now we only know thats what they do well at because thats all thats being tested Thats one of the problems of the test They dont look for other things that matter just as much The thing about work in Finland is this they dont obsess about those disciplines They have a very broad approach to education which includes humanities physical education the arts Second there is no standardized testing in Finland I mean theres a bit but its not what gets people up in the morning what keeps them at their desks The third thing  and I was at a meeting recently with some people from Finland actual Finnish people and somebody from the American system was saying to the people in Finland What do you do about the dropout rate in Finland And they all looked a bit bemused and said Well we dont have one Why would you drop out If people are in trouble we get to them quite quickly and we help and support them Now people always say Well you know you cant compare Finland to America No I think theres a population of around five million in Finland But you can compare it to a state in America Many states in America have fewer people in them than that I mean Ive been to some states in America and I was the only person there Really Really I was asked to lock up when I left But what all the highperforming systems in the world do is currently what is not evident sadly across the systems in America  I mean as a whole One is this they individualize teaching and learning They recognize that its students who are learning and the system has to engage them their curiosity their individuality and their creativity Thats how you get them to learn The second is that they attribute a very high status to the teaching profession They recognize that you cant improve education if you dont pick great people to teach and keep giving them constant support and professional development Investing in professional development is not a cost Its an investment and every other country thats succeeding well knows that whether its Australia Canada South Korea Singapore Hong Kong or Shanghai They know that to be the case And the third is they devolve responsibility to the school level for getting the job done You see theres a big difference here between going into a mode of command and control in education  Thats what happens in some systems Central or state governments decide they know best and theyre going to tell you what to do The trouble is that education doesnt go on in the committee rooms of our legislative buildings It happens in classrooms and schools and the people who do it are the teachers and the students and if you remove their discretion it stops working You have to put it back to the people There is wonderful work happening in this country But I have to say its happening in spite of the dominant culture of education not because of it Its like people are sailing into a headwind all the time And the reason I think is this that many of the current policies are based on mechanistic conceptions of education Its like education is an industrial process that can be improved just by having better data and somewhere in the back of the mind of some policy makers is this idea that if we finetune it well enough if we just get it right it will all hum along perfectly into the future It wont and it never did The point is that education is not a mechanical system Its a human system Its about people people who either do want to learn or dont want to learn Every student who drops out of school has a reason for it which is rooted in their own biography They may find it boring They may find it irrelevant They may find that its at odds with the life theyre living outside of school There are trends but the stories are always unique I was at a meeting recently in Los Angeles of  theyre called alternative education programs These are programs designed to get kids back into education They have certain common features Theyre very personalized They have strong support for the teachers close links with the community and a broad and diverse curriculum and often programs which involve students outside school as well as inside school And they work Whats interesting to me is these are called alternative education You know And all the evidence from around the world is if we all did that thered be no need for the alternative So I think we have to embrace a different metaphor We have to recognize that its a human system and there are conditions under which people thrive and conditions under which they dont We are after all organic creatures and the culture of the school is absolutely essential Culture is an organic term isnt it Not far from where I live is a place called Death Valley Death Valley is the hottest driest place in America and nothing grows there Nothing grows there because it doesnt rain Hence Death Valley In the winter of 2004 it rained in Death Valley Seven inches of rain fell over a very short period And in the spring of 2005 there was a phenomenon The whole floor of Death Valley was carpeted in flowers for a while What it proved is this that Death Valley isnt dead Its dormant Right beneath the surface are these seeds of possibility waiting for the right conditions to come about and with organic systems if the conditions are right life is inevitable It happens all the time You take an area a school a district you change the conditions give people a different sense of possibility a different set of expectations a broader range of opportunities you cherish and value the relationships between teachers and learners you offer people the discretion to be creative and to innovate in what they do and schools that were once bereft spring to life Great leaders know that The real role of leadership in education  and I think its true at the national level the state level at the school level  is not and should not be command and control The real role of leadership is climate control creating a climate of possibility And if you do that people will rise to it and achieve things that you completely did not anticipate and couldnt have expected Theres a wonderful quote from Benjamin Franklin There are three sorts of people in the world Those who are immovable people who dont get it or dont want to do anything about it there are people who are movable people who see the need for change and are prepared to listen to it and there are people who move people who make things happen And if we can encourage more people that will be a movement And if the movement is strong enough thats in the best sense of the word a revolution And thats what we need Thank you very much Thank you very muchJust a moment ago my daughter Rebecca texted me for good luck Her text said Mom you will rock I love this Getting that text was like getting a hug And so there you have it I embody the central paradox Im a woman who loves getting texts whos going to tell you that too many of them can be a problem Actually that reminder of my daughter brings me to the beginning of my story 1996 when I gave my first TEDTalk Rebecca was five years old and she was sitting right there in the front row I had just written a book that celebrated our life on the internet and I was about to be on the cover of Wired magazine In those heady days we were experimenting with chat rooms and online virtual communities We were exploring different aspects of ourselves And then we unplugged I was excited And as a psychologist what excited me most was the idea that we would use what we learned in the virtual world about ourselves about our identity to live better lives in the real world Now fastforward to 2012 Im back here on the TED stage again My daughters 20 Shes a college student She sleeps with her cellphone so do I And Ive just written a new book but this time its not one that will get me on the cover of Wired magazine So what happened Im still excited by technology but I believe and Im here to make the case that were letting it take us places that we dont want to go Over the past 15 years Ive studied technologies of mobile communication and Ive interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people young and old about their plugged in lives And what Ive found is that our little devices those little devices in our pockets are so psychologically powerful that they dont only change what we do they change who we are Some of the things we do now with our devices are things that only a few years ago we would have found odd or disturbing but theyve quickly come to seem familiar just how we do things So just to take some quick examples People text or do email during corporate board meetings They text and shop and go on Facebook during classes during presentations actually during all meetings People talk to me about the important new skill of making eye contact while youre texting People explain to me that its hard but that it can be done Parents text and do email at breakfast and at dinner while their children complain about not having their parents full attention But then these same children deny each other their full attention This is a recent shot of my daughter and her friends being together while not being together And we even text at funerals I study this We remove ourselves from our grief or from our revery and we go into our phones Why does this matter It matters to me because I think were setting ourselves up for trouble  trouble certainly in how we relate to each other but also trouble in how we relate to ourselves and our capacity for selfreflection Were getting used to a new way of being alone together People want to be with each other but also elsewhere  connected to all the different places they want to be People want to customize their lives They want to go in and out of all the places they are because the thing that matters most to them is control over where they put their attention So you want to go to that board meeting but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest you And some people think thats a good thing But you can end up hiding from each other even as were all constantly connected to each other A 50yearold business man lamented to me that he feels he doesnt have colleagues anymore at work When he goes to work he doesnt stop by to talk to anybody he doesnt call And he says he doesnt want to interrupt his colleagues because he says Theyre too busy on their email But then he stops himself and he says You know Im not telling you the truth Im the one who doesnt want to be interrupted I think I should want to but actually Id rather just do things on my Blackberry Across the generations I see that people cant get enough of each other if and only if they can have each other at a distance in amounts they can control I call it the Goldilocks effect not too close not too far just right But what might feel just right for that middleaged executive can be a problem for an adolescent who needs to develop facetoface relationships An 18yearold boy who uses texting for almost everything says to me wistfully Someday someday but certainly not now Id like to learn how to have a conversation When I ask people Whats wrong with having a conversation People say Ill tell you whats wrong with having a conversation It takes place in real time and you cant control what youre going to say So thats the bottom line Texting email posting all of these things let us present the self as we want to be We get to edit and that means we get to delete and that means we get to retouch the face the voice the flesh the body  not too little not too much just right Human relationships are rich and theyre messy and theyre demanding And we clean them up with technology And when we do one of the things that can happen is that we sacrifice conversation for mere connection We shortchange ourselves And over time we seem to forget this or we seem to stop caring I was caught off guard when Stephen Colbert asked me a profound question a profound question He said Dont all those little tweets dont all those little sips of online communication add up to one big gulp of real conversation My answer was no they dont add up Connecting in sips may work for gathering discrete bits of information they may work for saying Im thinking about you or even for saying I love you  I mean look at how I felt when I got that text from my daughter  but they dont really work for learning about each other for really coming to know and understand each other And we use conversations with each other to learn how to have conversations with ourselves So a flight from conversation can really matter because it can compromise our capacity for selfreflection For kids growing up that skill is the bedrock of development Over and over I hear I would rather text than talk And what Im seeing is that people get so used to being shortchanged out of real conversation so used to getting by with less that theyve become almost willing to dispense with people altogether So for example many people share with me this wish that some day a more advanced version of Siri the digital assistant on Apples iPhone will be more like a best friend someone who will listen when others wont I believe this wish reflects a painful truth that Ive learned in the past 15 years That feeling that no one is listening to me is very important in our relationships with technology Thats why its so appealing to have a Facebook page or a Twitter feed  so many automatic listeners And the feeling that no one is listening to me make us want to spend time with machines that seem to care about us Were developing robots they call them sociable robots that are specifically designed to be companions  to the elderly to our children to us Have we so lost confidence that we will be there for each other During my research I worked in nursing homes and I brought in these sociable robots that were designed to give the elderly the feeling that they were understood And one day I came in and a woman who had lost a child was talking to a robot in the shape of a baby seal It seemed to be looking in her eyes It seemed to be following the conversation It comforted her And many people found this amazing But that woman was trying to make sense of her life with a machine that had no experience of the arc of a human life That robot put on a great show And were vulnerable People experience pretend empathy as though it were the real thing So during that moment when that woman was experiencing that pretend empathy I was thinking That robot cant empathize It doesnt face death It doesnt know life And as that woman took comfort in her robot companion I didnt find it amazing I found it one of the most wrenching complicated moments in my 15 years of work But when I stepped back I felt myself at the cold hard center of a perfect storm We expect more from technology and less from each other And I ask myself Why have things come to this And I believe its because technology appeals to us most where we are most vulnerable And we are vulnerable Were lonely but were afraid of intimacy And so from social networks to sociable robots were designing technologies that will give us the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship We turn to technology to help us feel connected in ways we can comfortably control But were not so comfortable We are not so much in control These days those phones in our pockets are changing our minds and hearts because they offer us three gratifying fantasies One that we can put our attention wherever we want it to be two that we will always be heard and three that we will never have to be alone And that third idea that we will never have to be alone is central to changing our psyches Because the moment that people are alone even for a few seconds they become anxious they panic they fidget they reach for a device Just think of people at a checkout line or at a red light Being alone feels like a problem that needs to be solved And so people try to solve it by connecting But here connection is more like a symptom than a cure It expresses but it doesnt solve an underlying problem But more than a symptom constant connection is changing the way people think of themselves Its shaping a new way of being The best way to describe it is I share therefore I am We use technology to define ourselves by sharing our thoughts and feelings even as were having them So before it was I have a feeling I want to make a call Now its I want to have a feeling I need to send a text The problem with this new regime of I share therefore I am is that if we dont have connection we dont feel like ourselves We almost dont feel ourselves So what do we do We connect more and more But in the process we set ourselves up to be isolated How do you get from connection to isolation You end up isolated if you dont cultivate the capacity for solitude the ability to be separate to gather yourself Solitude is where you find yourself so that you can reach out to other people and form real attachments When we dont have the capacity for solitude we turn to other people in order to feel less anxious or in order to feel alive When this happens were not able to appreciate who they are Its as though were using them as spare parts to support our fragile sense of self We slip into thinking that always being connected is going to make us feel less alone But were at risk because actually its the opposite thats true If were not able to be alone were going to be more lonely And if we dont teach our children to be alone theyre only going to know how to be lonely When I spoke at TED in 1996 reporting on my studies of the early virtual communities I said Those who make the most of their lives on the screen come to it in a spirit of selfreflection And thats what Im calling for here now reflection and more than that a conversation about where our current use of technology may be taking us what it might be costing us Were smitten with technology And were afraid like young lovers that too much talking might spoil the romance But its time to talk We grew up with digital technology and so we see it as all grown up But its not its early days Theres plenty of time for us to reconsider how we use it how we build it Im not suggesting that we turn away from our devices just that we develop a more selfaware relationship with them with each other and with ourselves I see some first steps Start thinking of solitude as a good thing Make room for it Find ways to demonstrate this as a value to your children Create sacred spaces at home  the kitchen the dining room  and reclaim them for conversation Do the same thing at work At work were so busy communicating that we often dont have time to think we dont have time to talk about the things that really matter Change that Most important we all really need to listen to each other including to the boring bits Because its when we stumble or hesitate or lose our words that we reveal ourselves to each other Technology is making a bid to redefine human connection  how we care for each other how we care for ourselves  but its also giving us the opportunity to affirm our values and our direction Im optimistic We have everything we need to start We have each other And we have the greatest chance of success if we recognize our vulnerability That we listen when technology says it will take something complicated and promises something simpler So in my work I hear that life is hard relationships are filled with risk And then theres technology  simpler hopeful optimistic everyoung Its like calling in the cavalry An ad campaign promises that online and with avatars you can Finally love your friends love your body love your life online and with avatars Were drawn to virtual romance to computer games that seem like worlds to the idea that robots robots will someday be our true companions We spend an evening on the social network instead of going to the pub with friends But our fantasies of substitution have cost us Now we all need to focus on the many many ways technology can lead us back to our real lives our own bodies our own communities our own politics our own planet They need us Lets talk about how we can use digital technology the technology of our dreams to make this life the life we can love Thank you
