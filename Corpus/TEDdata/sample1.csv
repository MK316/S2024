1,"How to speak so that people want to listen
JULIAN TREASURE",SHS,6_12,Y,"The human voice: It's the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound in the world, probably. It's the only one that can start a war or say ""I love you."" And yet many people have the experience that when they speak, people don't listen to them. And why is that? How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world?

00:24
What I'd like to suggest, there are a number of habits that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking. I'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list, but these seven, I think, are pretty large habits that we can all fall into.

00:40
First, gossip. Speaking ill of somebody who's not present. Not a nice habit, and we know perfectly well the person gossiping, five minutes later, will be gossiping about us.

00:53
Second, judging. We know people who are like this in conversation, and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time.

01:03
Third, negativity. You can fall into this. My mother, in the last years of her life, became very negative, and it's hard to listen. I remember one day, I said to her, ""It's October 1 today,"" and she said, ""I know, isn't it dreadful?""

01:16
(Laughter)

01:18
It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative.

01:21
(Laughter)

01:22
And another form of negativity, complaining. Well, this is the national art of the U.K. It's our national sport. We complain about the weather, sport, about politics, about everything, but actually, complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world.

01:39
Excuses.

01:41
We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blamethrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions, and again, hard to listen to somebody who is being like that.

01:54
Penultimate, the sixth of the seven, embroidery, exaggeration. It demeans our language, actually, sometimes. For example, if I see something that really is awesome, what do I call it?

02:06
(Laughter)

02:09
And then, of course, this exaggeration becomes lying, and we don't want to listen to people we know are lying to us.

02:15
And finally, dogmatism. The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind. You know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that.

02:32
So here they are, seven deadly sins of speaking. These are things I think we need to avoid. But is there a positive way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones, foundations, that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world. Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is ""hail,"" and it has a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition, to greet or acclaim enthusiastically, which is how I think our words will be received if we stand on these four things.

03:10
So what do they stand for? See if you can guess. The H, honesty, of course, being true in what you say, being straight and clear. The A is authenticity, just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The I is integrity, being your word, actually doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love, but I do mean wishing people well, for two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want. I mean, my goodness, you look ugly this morning. Perhaps that's not necessary. Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really wishing somebody well, it's very hard to judge them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously. So hail.

04:08
Also, now that's what you say, and it's like the old song, it is what you say, it's also the way that you say it. You have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible, and yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play with, which will increase the power of your speaking.

04:29
Register, for example. Now, falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches. You can locate your voice, however. So if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference? We vote for politicians with lower voices, it's true, because we associate depth with power and with authority. That's register.

05:07
Then we have timbre. It's the way your voice feels. Again, the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich, smooth, warm, like hot chocolate. Well if that's not you, that's not the end of the world, because you can train. Go and get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing, with posture, and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice.

05:30
Then prosody. I love prosody. This is the sing-song, the meta-language that we use in order to impart meaning. It's root one for meaning in conversation. People who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the word ""monotonic"" comes from, or monotonous, monotone. Also, we have repetitive prosody now coming in, where every sentence ends as if it were a question when it's actually not a question, it's a statement?

06:00
(Laughter)

06:02
And if you repeat that one, it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody, which I think is a shame, so let's try and break that habit.

06:12
Pace.

06:13
I can get very excited by saying something really quickly, or I can slow right down to emphasize, and at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence. There's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk, is there? We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs. It can be very powerful.

06:35
Of course, pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? (Higher pitch) Where did you leave my keys? So, slightly different meaning in those two deliveries.

06:47
And finally, volume. (Loud) I can get really excited by using volume. Sorry about that, if I startled anybody. Or, I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet. Some people broadcast the whole time. Try not to do that. That's called sodcasting,

07:05
(Laughter)

07:06
Imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately. Not nice.

07:12
Of course, where this all comes into play most of all is when you've got something really important to do. It might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing marriage, asking for a raise, a wedding speech. Whatever it is, if it's really important, you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on, and no engine works well without being warmed up. Warm up your voice.

07:38
Actually, let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand up for a moment? I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do. Any time you're going to talk to anybody important, do these. First, arms up, deep breath in, and sigh out, ahhhhh, like that. One more time. Ahhhh, very good. Now we're going to warm up our lips, and we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good. And now, brrrrrrrrrr, just like when you were a kid. Brrrr. Now your lips should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. Beautiful. You're getting really good at this. And then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr. That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally, and if I can only do one, the pros call this the siren. It's really good. It starts with ""we"" and goes to ""aw."" The ""we"" is high, the ""aw"" is low. So you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww.

08:46
Fantastic. Give yourselves a round of applause. Take a seat, thank you.

08:49
(Applause)

08:51
Next time you speak, do those in advance.

08:53
Now let me just put this in context to close. This is a serious point here. This is where we are now, right? We speak not very well to people who simply aren't listening in an environment that's all about noise and bad acoustics. I have talked about that on this stage in different phases. What would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who were listening consciously in environments which were actually fit for purpose? Or to make that a bit larger, what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound? That would be a world that does sound beautiful, and one where understanding would be the norm, and that is an idea worth spreading.

09:40
Thank you.

09:41
(Applause)"
2,"The next outbreak? We're not ready
BILL GATES",SHS,6_12,Y,"When I was a kid, the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war. That's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement, filled with cans of food and water.
When the nuclear attack came, we were supposed to go downstairs, hunker down, and eat out of that barrel. Today the greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn't look like this. Instead, it looks like this. If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war. Not missiles, but microbes. Now, part of the reason for this is that we've invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents. But we've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic. We're not ready for the next epidemic. Let's look at Ebola. I'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper, lots of tough challenges. I followed it carefully through the case analysis tools we use to track polio eradication. And as you look at what went on, the problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't work well enough, the problem was that we didn't have a system at all. In fact, there's some pretty obvious
key missing pieces. We didn't have a group of epidemiologists ready to go, who would have gone, seen what the disease was, seen how far it had spread. The case reports came in on paper. It was very delayed before they were put online and they were extremely inaccurate. We didn't have a medical team ready to go. We didn't have a way of preparing people.
Now, Médecins Sans Frontières did a great job orchestrating volunteers. But even so, we were far slower than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these countries. And a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers. There was no one there to look at treatment approaches. No one to look at the diagnostics. No one to figure out what tools should be used. As an example, we could have taken the blood of survivors, processed it, and put that plasma back in people to protect them. But that was never tried. So there was a lot that was missing. And these things are really a global failure. The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics, but not to do these things I talked about. Now, in the movies it's quite different.
There's a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go, they move in, they save the day, but that's just pure Hollywood. The failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic
to be dramatically more devastating than Ebola Let's look at the progression 
of Ebola over this year. About 10,000 people died, and nearly all were in the three
West African countries.
There's three reasons why
it didn't spread more.
The first is that there was a lot 
of heroic work by the health workers.
They found the people and they 
prevented more infections.
The second is the nature of the virus.
Ebola does not spread through the air.
And by the time you're contagious,
most people are so sick 
that they're bedridden.
Third, it didn't get
into many urban areas.
And that was just luck.
If it had gotten into a lot 
more urban areas,
the case numbers 
would have been much larger.
So next time, we might not be so lucky.
You can have a virus where people 
feel well enough while they're infectious
that they get on a plane
or they go to a market.
The source of the virus could be 
a natural epidemic like Ebola,
or it could be bioterrorism.
So there are things that would literally
make things a thousand times worse.
In fact, let's look at a model
of a virus spread through the air,
like the Spanish Flu back in 1918.
So here's what would happen:
It would spread throughout the world
very, very quickly.
And you can see over 30 million people
died from that epidemic.
So this is a serious problem.
We should be concerned.
But in fact, we can build
a really good response system.
We have the benefits of all the science
and technology that we talk about here.
We've got cell phones
to get information from the public 
and get information out to them.
We have satellite maps where we can see
where people are and where they're moving.
We have advances in biology
that should dramatically change 
the turnaround time to look at a pathogen
and be able to make drugs and vaccines
that fit for that pathogen.
So we can have tools,
but those tools need to be put
into an overall global health system.
And we need preparedness.
The best lessons, I think, 
on how to get prepared
are again, what we do for war.
For soldiers, we have full-time,
waiting to go.
We have reserves that can scale 
us up to large numbers.
NATO has a mobile unit 
that can deploy very rapidly.
NATO does a lot of war games 
to check, are people well trained?
Do they understand 
about fuel and logistics
and the same radio frequencies?
So they are absolutely ready to go.
So those are the kinds of things
we need to deal with an epidemic.
What are the key pieces?
First, we need strong health systems
in poor countries.
That's where mothers 
can give birth safely,
kids can get all their vaccines.
But, also where we'll see 
the outbreak very early on.
We need a medical reserve corps:
lots of people who've got 
the training and background
who are ready to go, with the expertise.
And then we need to pair those
medical people with the military.
taking advantage of the military's ability
to move fast, do logistics
and secure areas.
We need to do simulations,
germ games, not war games,
so that we see where the holes are.
The last time a germ game 
was done in the United States
was back in 2001, 
and it didn't go so well.
So far the score is germs: 1, people: 0.
Finally, we need lots of advanced R&D
in areas of vaccines and diagnostics.
There are some big breakthroughs, 
like the Adeno-associated virus,
that could work very, very quickly.
Now I don't have an exact budget
for what this would cost,
but I'm quite sure it's very modest
compared to the potential harm.
The World Bank estimates that 
if we have a worldwide flu epidemic,
global wealth will go down
by over three trillion dollars
and we'd have millions
and millions of deaths.
These investments 
offer significant benefits
beyond just being ready for the epidemic.
The primary healthcare, the R&D,
those things would reduce 
global health equity
and make the world more just 
as well as more safe.
So I think this should absolutely
be a priority.
There's no need to panic.
We don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti
or go down into the basement.
But we need to get going,
because time is not on our side.
In fact, if there's one positive thing
that can come out of the Ebola epidemic,
it's that it can serve as an early 
warning, a wake-up call, to get ready.
If we start now, we can be ready 
for the next epidemic.
Thank you.

3,"What it takes to be a great leader 
ROSELINDE TORRES",SHS,6_12,Y,"What makes a great leader today? Many of us carry this image of this all-knowing superhero who stands and commands and protects his followers. But that's kind of an image from another time, and what's also outdated are the leadership development programs that are based on success models for a world that was, not a world that is or that is coming. 

00:38 
We conducted a study of 4,000 companies, and we asked them, let's see the effectiveness of your leadership development programs. Fifty-eight percent of the companies cited significant talent gaps for critical leadership roles. That means that despite corporate training programs, off-sites, assessments, coaching, all of these things, more than half the companies had failed to grow enough great leaders. You may be asking yourself, is my company helping me to prepare to be a great 21st-century leader? The odds are, probably not. 

01:21 
Now, I've spent 25 years of my professional life observing what makes great leaders. I've worked inside Fortune 500 companies, I've advised over 200 CEOs, and I've cultivated more leadership pipelines than you can imagine. But a few years ago, I noticed a disturbing trend in leadership preparation. I noticed that, despite all the efforts, there were familiar stories that kept resurfacing about individuals. One story was about Chris, a high-potential, superstar leader who moves to a new unit and fails, destroying unrecoverable value. And then there were stories like Sidney, the CEO, who was so frustrated because her company is cited as a best company for leaders, but only one of the top 50 leaders is equipped to lead their crucial initiatives. And then there were stories like the senior leadership team of a once-thriving business that's surprised by a market shift, finds itself having to force the company to reduce its size in half or go out of business. 

02:41 
Now, these recurring stories cause me to ask two questions. Why are the leadership gaps widening when there's so much more investment in leadership development? And what are the great leaders doing distinctly different to thrive and grow? One of the things that I did, I was so consumed by these questions and also frustrated by those stories, that I left my job so that I could study this full time, and I took a year to travel to different parts of the world to learn about effective and ineffective leadership practices in companies, countries and nonprofit organizations. And so I did things like travel to South Africa, where I had an opportunity to understand how Nelson Mandela was ahead of his time in anticipating and navigating his political, social and economic context. I also met a number of nonprofit leaders who, despite very limited financial resources, were making a huge impact in the world, often bringing together seeming adversaries. And I spent countless hours in presidential libraries trying to understand how the environment had shaped the leaders, the moves that they made, and then the impact of those moves beyond their tenure. And then, when I returned to work full time, in this role, I joined with wonderful colleagues who were also interested in these questions. 

04:18 
Now, from all this, I distilled the characteristics of leaders who are thriving and what they do differently, and then I also distilled the preparation practices that enable people to grow to their potential. I want to share some of those with you now. 

04:37 
(""What makes a great leader in the 21st century?"") 

04:39 
In a 21st-century world, which is more global, digitally enabled and transparent, with faster speeds of information flow and innovation, and where nothing big gets done without some kind of a complex matrix, relying on traditional development practices will stunt your growth as a leader. In fact, traditional assessments like narrow 360 surveys or outdated performance criteria will give you false positives, lulling you into thinking that you are more prepared than you really are. Leadership in the 21st century is defined and evidenced by three questions. 

05:22 
Where are you looking to anticipate the next change to your business model or your life? The answer to this question is on your calendar. Who are you spending time with? On what topics? Where are you traveling? What are you reading? And then how are you distilling this into understanding potential discontinuities, and then making a decision to do something right now so that you're prepared and ready? There's a leadership team that does a practice where they bring together each member collecting, here are trends that impact me, here are trends that impact another team member, and they share these, and then make decisions, to course-correct a strategy or to anticipate a new move. Great leaders are not head-down. They see around corners, shaping their future, not just reacting to it. 

06:21 
The second question is, what is the diversity measure of your personal and professional stakeholder network? You know, we hear often about good ol' boy networks and they're certainly alive and well in many institutions. But to some extent, we all have a network of people that we're comfortable with. So this question is about your capacity to develop relationships with people that are very different than you. And those differences can be biological, physical, functional, political, cultural, socioeconomic. And yet, despite all these differences, they connect with you and they trust you enough to cooperate with you in achieving a shared goal. Great leaders understand that having a more diverse network is a source of pattern identification at greater levels and also of solutions, because you have people that are thinking differently than you are. 

07:22 
Third question: are you courageous enough to abandon a practice that has made you successful in the past? There's an expression: Go along to get along. But if you follow this advice, chances are as a leader, you're going to keep doing what's familiar and comfortable. Great leaders dare to be different. They don't just talk about risk-taking, they actually do it. And one of the leaders shared with me the fact that the most impactful development comes when you are able to build the emotional stamina to withstand people telling you that your new idea is naïve or reckless or just plain stupid. Now interestingly, the people who will join you are not your usual suspects in your network. They're often people that think differently and therefore are willing to join you in taking a courageous leap. And it's a leap, not a step. More than traditional leadership programs, answering these three questions will determine your effectiveness as a 21st-century leader. 

08:38 
So what makes a great leader in the 21st century? I've met many, and they stand out. They are women and men who are preparing themselves not for the comfortable predictability of yesterday but also for the realities of today and all of those unknown possibilities of tomorrow. 

09:00 
Thank you."
4,"Looks aren't everything. Believe me, I'm a model.
CAMERON RUSSELL",SHS,6_12,Y,"Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for the last little while, I've been a model. Actually, for 10 years. And I feel like there's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress.

00:23
(Laughter)

00:25
So luckily, I brought an outfit change. This is the first outfit change on the TED stage, so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it, I think. If some of the women were really horrified when I came out, you don't have to tell me now, but I'll find out later on Twitter.

00:40
(Laughter)

00:45
I'd also note that I'm quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds. Not everybody gets to do that. These heels are very uncomfortable, so good thing I wasn't going to wear them. The worst part is putting this sweater over my head, because that's when you'll all laugh at me, so don't do anything while it's over my head. All right.

01:14
So, why did I do that? That was awkward.

01:18
(Laughter)

01:20
Well --

01:21
(Laughter)

01:23
Hopefully not as awkward as that picture. Image is powerful, but also, image is superficial. I just totally transformed what you thought of me, in six seconds. And in this picture, I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life. I was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy's hair. And of course, barring surgery, or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work, there's very little that we can do to transform how we look, and how we look, though it is superficial and immutable, has a huge impact on our lives.

02:11
So today, for me, being fearless means being honest. And I am on this stage because I am a model. I am on this stage because I am a pretty, white woman, and in my industry, we call that a sexy girl. I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but with an honest twist.

02:29
So the first question is, how do you become a model? I always just say, ""Oh, I was scouted,"" but that means nothing. The real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery, and I am the recipient of a legacy, and maybe you're wondering what is a legacy. Well, for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we're biologically programmed to admire, but also as tall, slender figures, and femininity and white skin. And this is a legacy that was built for me, and it's a legacy that I've been cashing out on. And I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point, and maybe there are some fashionistas who are like, ""Wait. Naomi. Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu Wen."" And first, I commend you on your model knowledge. Very impressive.

03:19
(Laughter)

03:21
But unfortunately, I have to inform you that in 2007, a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the runway, every single one that was hired, and of the 677 models that were hired, only 27, or less than four percent, were non-white.

03:39
The next question people always ask is, ""Can I be a model when I grow up?"" And the first answer is, ""I don't know, they don't put me in charge of that."" But the second answer, and what I really want to say to these little girls is, ""Why? You know? You can be anything. You could be the President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet, which would be awesome, because you'd be the first one.""

04:01
(Laughter)

04:03
If, after this amazing list, they still are like, ""No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model,"" well, then I say, ""Be my boss."" Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the editor in chief of American Vogue or the CEO of H&amp;M, or the next Steven Meisel. Saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up. It's out of your control, and it's awesome, and it's not a career path.

04:27
I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge, because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons, it can just be distilled right now. So, if the photographer is right there, the light is right there, like a nice HMI, and the client says, ""We want a walking shot,"" this leg goes first, nice and long, this arm goes back, this arm goes forward, the head is at three quarters, and you just go back and forth, just do that, and then you look back at your imaginary friends, 300, 400, 500 times.

04:55
(Laughter)

04:56
It will look something like this.

04:58
(Laughter)

05:00
Hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle. That was -- I don't know what happened there.

05:06
Unfortunately, after you've gone to school, and you have a résumé and you've done a few jobs, you can't say anything anymore, so if you say you want to be the President of the United States, but your résumé reads, ""Underwear Model: 10 years,"" people give you a funny look.

05:19
The next question is, ""Do they retouch all the photos?"" And yeah, they pretty much retouch all the photos, but that is only a small component of what's happening. This picture is the very first picture that I ever took, and it's also the very first time that I had worn a bikini, and I didn't even have my period yet. I know we're getting personal, but I was a young girl. This is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier. Here's me on the same day as this shoot. My friend got to come. Here's me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue. Here's me on the soccer team and in V Magazine. And here's me today. And I hope what you're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me. They are constructions, and they are constructions by a group of professionals, by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production, and they build this. That's not me.

06:12
Okay, so the next question people always ask me is, ""Do you get free stuff?""

06:16
(Laughter)

06:17
I do have too many 8-inch heels which I never get to wear, except for earlier, but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life, and that's what we don't like to talk about.

06:28
I grew up in Cambridge, and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free. When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course, we got pulled over, and all it took was a ""Sorry, officer,"" and we were on our way. And I got these free things because of how I look, not who I am, and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are.

I live in New York, and last year, of the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked, 86% of them were black and Latino, and most of them were young men. And there are only 177,000 young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of, ""Will I get stopped?"" but ""How many times will I get stopped? When will I get stopped?"" When I was researching this talk, I found out that of the 13-year-old girls in the United States, 53% don't like their bodies, and that number goes to 78% by the time that they're 17.

07:25
So, the last question people ask me is, ""What is it like to be a model?"" And I think the answer that they're looking for is, ""If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair, you will be so happy and fabulous."" And when we're backstage, we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that. We say, ""It's really amazing to travel, and it's amazing to get to work with creative, inspired, passionate people."" And those things are true, but they're only one half of the story, because the thing that we never say on camera, that I have never said on camera, is, ""I am insecure."" And I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day. And if you ever are wondering, ""If I have thinner thighs and shinier hair, will I be happier?"" you just need to meet a group of models, because they have the thinnest thighs, the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes, and they're the most physically insecure women probably on the planet.

08:20
When I was writing this talk, I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance, because on the one hand, I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say, ""Look I've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor,"" and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with, ""and it doesn't always make me happy."" But mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when I am one of the biggest beneficiaries.

08:47
But I'm also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it's great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I'd had more agency in my career, because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job, or maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college, which seems so important right now.

09:05
If there's a takeaway to this talk, I hope it's that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures.

09:16
Thank you.

5,"Give yourself permission to be creative 
ETHAN HAWKE",SHS,6_12,Y,"I was hoping today to talk a little bit about creativity. You know, a lot of people really struggle to give themselves permission to be creative. And reasonably so. I mean, we're all a little suspect of our own talent. And I remember a story I came across in my early 20s that kind of meant a lot to me. 

00:23 
I was really into Allen Ginsberg, and I was reading his poetry, and I was reading -- he did a lot of interviews -- and one time, William F. Buckley had this television program called ""Firing Line,"" and Ginsberg went on there and sang a Hare Krishna song while playing the harmonium. And he got back to New York to all his intelligentsia friends, and they all told him, ""Don't you know that everybody thinks you're an idiot, and the whole country's making fun of you?"" And he said, ""That's my job. I'm a poet, and I'm going to play the fool. Most people have to go to work all day long, and they come home and they fight with their spouse, and they eat, and they turn on the old boob tube, and somebody tries to sell them something, and I just screwed all that up. I went on and I sang about Krishna, and now they're sitting in bed and going, 'Who is this stupid poet?' And they can't fall asleep, right?"" And that's his job as a poet. 

01:17 
And so, I find that very liberating, because I think that most of us really want to offer the world something of quality, something that the world will consider good or important. And that's really the enemy, because it's not up to us whether what we do is any good, and if history has taught us anything, the world is an extremely unreliable critic. Right? 

01:43 
So you have to ask yourself: Do you think human creativity matters? Well, hmm. Most people don't spend a lot of time thinking about poetry. Right? They have a life to live, and they're not really that concerned with Allen Ginsberg's poems or anybody's poems, until their father dies, they go to a funeral, you lose a child, somebody breaks your heart, they don't love you anymore, and all of a sudden, you're desperate for making sense out of this life, and, ""Has anybody ever felt this bad before? How did they come out of this cloud?"" 

02:20 
Or the inverse -- something great. You meet somebody and your heart explodes. You love them so much, you can't even see straight. You know, you're dizzy. ""Did anybody feel like this before? What is happening to me?"" And that's when art's not a luxury, it's actually sustenance. We need it. 

02:37 
OK. Well, what is it? Human creativity is nature manifest in us. We look at the, oh ... the aurora borealis. Right? I did this movie called ""White Fang"" when I was a kid, and we shot up in Alaska, and you go out at night and the sky was like rippling with purple and pink and white, and it's the most beautiful thing I ever saw. It really looked like the sky was playing. Beautiful. You go to Grand Canyon at sundown. It's beautiful. We know that's beautiful. But fall in love? Your lover's pretty beautiful. I have four kids. Watching them play? Watching them pretend to be a butterfly or run around the house and doing anything, it's so beautiful. 

03:21 
And I believe that we are here on this star in space to try to help one another. Right? And first we have to survive, and then we have to thrive. And to thrive, to express ourselves, alright, well, here's the rub: we have to know ourselves. What do you love? And if you get close to what you love, who you are is revealed to you, and it expands. 

03:46 
For me, it was really easy. I did my first professional play. I was 12 years old. I was in a play called ""Saint Joan"" by George Bernard Shaw at the McCarter Theatre, and -- boom! -- I was in love. My world just expanded. And that profession -- I'm almost 50 now -- that profession has never stopped giving back to me, and it gives back more and more, mostly, strangely, through the characters that I've played. 

04:11 
I've played cops, I've played criminals, I've played priests, I've played sinners, and the magic of this over a lifetime, over 30 years of doing this, is that you start to see that my experiences, me, Ethan, is not nearly as unique as I thought. I have so much in common with all these people. And so they have something in common with me. You start to see how connected we all are. 

04:40 
My great-grandmother, Della Hall Walker Green, on her deathbed, she wrote this little biography in the hospital, and it was only about 36 pages long, and she spent about five pages on the one time she did costumes for a play. Her first husband got, like, a paragraph. Cotton farming, of which she did for 50 years, gets a mention. Five pages on doing these costumes. And I look -- my mom gave me one of her quilts that she made, and you can feel it. She was expressing herself, and it has a power that's real. 

05:18 
I remember my stepbrother and I went to go see ""Top Gun,"" whatever year that came out. And I remember we walked out of the mall, it was, like, blazing hot, I just looked at him, and we both felt that movie just like a calling from God. You know? Just ... But completely differently. Like, I wanted to be an actor. I was like, I've got to make something that makes people feel. I just want to be a part of that. And he wanted to be in the military. That's all we ever did was play FBI, play army man, play knights, you know, and I'd like, pose with my sword, and he would build a working crossbow that you could shoot an arrow into a tree. So he joins the army. Well, he just retired a colonel in the Green Berets. He's a multidecorated combat veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq. He now teaches a sail camp for children of fallen soldiers. He gave his life to his passion. His creativity was leadership, leading others, his bravery, to help others. That was something he felt called to do, and it gave back to him. 

06:15 
We know this -- the time of our life is so short, and how we spend it -- are we spending it doing what's important to us? Most of us not. I mean, it's hard. The pull of habit is so huge, and that's what makes kids so beautifully creative, is that they don't have any habits, and they don't care if they're any good or not, right? They're not building a sandcastle going, ""I think I'm going to be a really good sandcastle builder."" They just throw themselves at whatever project you put in front of them -- dancing, doing a painting, building something: any opportunity they have, they try to use it to impress upon you their individuality. It's so beautiful. 

06:56 
It's a thing that worries me sometimes whenever you talk about creativity, because it can have this kind of feel that it's just nice, you know, or it's warm or it's something pleasant. It's not. It's vital. It's the way we heal each other. In singing our song, in telling our story, in inviting you to say, ""Hey, listen to me, and I'll listen to you,"" we're starting a dialogue. And when you do that, this healing happens, and we come out of our corners, and we start to witness each other's common humanity. We start to assert it. And when we do that, really good things happen. 

07:34 
So, if you want to help your community, if you want to help your family, if you want to help your friends, you have to express yourself. And to express yourself, you have to know yourself. It's actually super easy. You just have to follow your love. There is no path. There's no path till you walk it, and you have to be willing to play the fool. So don't read the book that you should read, read the book you want to read. Don't listen to the music that you used to like. Take some time to listen to some new music. Take some time to talk to somebody that you don't normally talk to. I guarantee, if you do that, you will feel foolish. That's the point. Play the fool.

08:46 
(Sings) Well, I want to go Austin, and I wanna stay home. Invite our friends over but still be alone. Live for danger. Play it cool. Have everyone respect me for being a fool."
