We will cover the coverage of these stories right after the headlines . @(NEWSBREAK) @!BURNS : You 've heard of slow times in the news business ? The past few weeks have been as fast as they get .

I 'm Eric Burns . \" FOX News Watch \" is coming right up . @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!GEORGE-W-BUSH-PRE : Americans have every right to expect a more effective response in a time of emergency . When the federal government fails to meet such an obligation , I as president am responsible for the problem . And for the solution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katrina Thursday night .

        "+ Using Raw String: In Python, backslashes (\\) in standard strings are treated as escape characters. For example, \\n represents a newline, and \\t represents a tab. If you want to include an actual backslash in a string, you would normally need to escape it by using \\\\. This can become confusing and error-prone, especially in regular expressions which frequently use backslashes to denote special pattern sequences like \\s (for whitespace), \\d (for digits), and others.\n",
