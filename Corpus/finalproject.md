# ðŸŒ± Corpus Linguistics & English Education: Final project (Guideline)

### Overview
The final project for this course will encourage students to analyze aspects of English language or English education related to their own interests based on big data. They will utilize real data such as conversational speech materials and online corpora to verify their hypotheses. This research will employ quantitative methodology and demonstrate the ability to process, analyze, visualize, and statistically analyze data using simple Python coding. (Note: While actively utilizing GT during the assignment is encouraged, students must personally verify or validate the processing results.)

### Data

+ TED100 transcripts + online corpus (if needed, depending on your hypothesis)

### Project structure & reporting
