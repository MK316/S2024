Belling the cat,"The Mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to free themselves of their enemy, the Cat. At least they wished to find some way of knowing when she was coming, so they might have time to run away. Indeed, something had to be done, for they lived in such constant fear of her claws that they hardly dared stir from their dens by night or day.

Many plans were discussed, but none of them was thought good enough. At last a very young Mouse got up and said:

""I have a plan that seems very simple, but I know it will be successful.

All we have to do is to hang a bell about the Cat's neck. When we hear the bell ringing we will know immediately that our enemy is coming.""

All the Mice were much surprised that they had not thought of such a plan before. But in the midst of the rejoicing over their good fortune, an old Mouse arose and said:

""I will say that the plan of the young Mouse is very good. But let me ask one question: Who will bell the Cat?""

It is one thing to say that something should be done, but quite a different matter to do it."
The fox and the grape,"A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.

The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain.

Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.

""What a fool I am,"" he said. ""Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for.""

And off he walked very, very scornfully.

There are many who pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach."
The plane tree,"Two Travellers, walking in the noonday sun, sought the shade of a widespreading tree to rest. As they lay looking up among the pleasant leaves, they saw that it was a Plane Tree.

""How useless is the Plane!"" said one of them. ""It bears no fruit whatever, and only serves to litter the ground with leaves.""

""Ungrateful creatures!"" said a voice from the Plane Tree. ""You lie here in my cooling shade, and yet you say I am useless! Thus ungratefully, O Jupiter, do men receive their blessings!""

Our best blessings are often the least appreciated."
